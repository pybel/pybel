`0.9.3 <https://github.com/pybel/pybel/compare/v0.9.2...0.9.3>`_ - 2017-10-19
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added
~~~~~
- Convenience functions for adding qualified and unqualified edges to BELGraph class
- Sialic Acid Example BEL Graph
- EGF Example BEL Graph
- Added PyBEL Web export and stub for import
- BioPAX Import
- Dedicated BEL Syntax error

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Update the BEL Script canonicalization rules to group citations then evidences better
- Removed requirement of annotation entry in edge data dictionaries
- Confident enough to make using the edge store True by default

Fixed
~~~~~
- Fixed unset list parsing so it doesn't need quotes (#234)

Removed
~~~~~~~
- In-memory caching of authors

`0.9.2 <https://github.com/pybel/pybel/compare/v0.9.1...0.9.2>`_ - 2017-09-27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed
~~~~~
- JSON Serialization bug for authors in Citation Model

`0.9.1 <https://github.com/pybel/pybel/compare/v0.9.0...0.9.1>`_ - 2017-09-26
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added
~~~~~
- INDRA Import
- Usage of built-in operators on BEL Graphs

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Update list recent networks function to work better with SQL 99 compliant (basically everything except the
  old version of MySQL and SQLite) RDBMS
- Better tests for queries to edge store
- Better testing when extensions not installed (c1ac850)
- Update documentation to new OpenBEL website links

Fixed
~~~~~
- Fix crash when uploading network to edge store that has annotation pattern definitions (still needs some work though)
- Added foreign keys for first and last authors in Citation model (requires database rebuild)
- Froze NetworkX version at 1.11 since 2.0 breaks everything

Removed
~~~~~~~
- Don't cache SQLAlchemy models locally (3d7d238)

`0.9.0 <https://github.com/pybel/pybel/compare/v0.8.1...0.9.0>`_ - 2017-09-19
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added
~~~~~
- Option for setting scopefunc in Manager
- Include extra citation information on inserting graph to database that might have come from citation enrichment
- Node model to tuple and json functions are now complete

Changed
~~~~~~~
- Added members lists to the node data dictionaries for complex and composite nodes
- Added reactants and products lists to the node data dictionaries for reaction nodes

Fixed
~~~~~~~
- GOCC and other location caching problem
- Node tuples for reactions are now using standard node tuples for reactants and products. This was a huge issue
  but it had never come up before. DANGER - this means all old code will still work, but any node-tuple reliant
  code will have unexpected results. This also means that the node hashes in the database for all reactions will
  now be outdated, so the minimum version is being bumped.
