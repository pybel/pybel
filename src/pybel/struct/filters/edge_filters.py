"""Filter functions for edges in BEL graphs.

A edge predicate is a function that takes five arguments: a :class:`BELGraph`, a source node tuple, a target node
tuple, a key, and a data dictionary. It returns a boolean representing whether the edge passed the given test.

This module contains a set of default functions for filtering lists of edges and building edge predicate functions.

A general use for an edge predicate is to use the built-in :func:`filter` in code like
:code:`filter(your_edge_predicate, graph.edges(keys=True, data=True))`
