"""

PyBEL's main data structure is a subclass of :class:`networkx.MultiDiGraph`.

The graph contains metadata for the PyBEL version, the BEL script metadata, the namespace definitions, the
annotation definitions, and the warnings produced in analysis. Like any :mod:`networkx` graph, all attributes of
a given object can be accessed through the :code:`graph` property, like in: :code:`my_graph.graph['my key']`.
Convenient property definitions are given for these attributes.
