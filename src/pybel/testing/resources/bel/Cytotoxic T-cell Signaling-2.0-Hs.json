Expanding on these processes, the network highlights the chemokines secreted by macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as the cognate T-cell receptors, involved in mediating T-cell recruitment to compromised lung tissue during COPD development.",

If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

Addition of the same ligands to Jurkat T cells engineered to express CXCR3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with molecular weights similar to those in normal cells. Immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies identified Zeta-associated protein of 70,000 molecular weight (ZAP-70), linker for the activation of T cells (LAT), and phospholipase-C-gamma1 (PLCgamma1) to be among the proteins that become phosphorylated upon CXCR3 activation.

High levels of IL-2Ralpha provide a mean for continual capture of IL-2 to sustain signaling whereas limiting IL-15Ralpha tempers engagement of CD122 and gamma C, limiting signal transduction. Thus, varied levels of IL-2Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha provide a simple, yet powerful, mechanism to quantify and tune signaling through common intermediates leading to distinctive biological responses.",

However, when co-expressed with Vav1, Ly-GDI enhances Vav1 induction of NFAT activation, phospholipase Cgamma phosphorylation, and calcium mobilization.",

This mutation leads to constitutive activation of FGFR3.  We show that the kinase domains of FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4 containing the activation loop mutation, when targeted to the plasma membrane by a myristylation signal, can transform NIH3T3 cells and induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Phosphorylation of Shp2, PLC-gamma, and MAPK was also stimulated by all three 'TDII-like' FGFR derivatives. Additionally, activation of Stat1 and Stat3 was observed in cells expressing the activated FGFR derivatives. Finally, we demonstrate that FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4 derivatives can stimulate PI-3 kinase activity. ",

High levels of IL-2Ralpha provide a mean for continual capture of IL-2 to sustain signaling whereas limiting IL-15Ralpha tempers engagement of CD122 and gamma C, limiting signal transduction. Thus, varied levels of IL-2Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha provide a simple, yet powerful, mechanism to quantify and tune signaling through common intermediates leading to distinctive biological responses.",

Here, we evaluate the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to a panel of genetically diverse R5 and X4 envelope proteins. Modulation of gene expression was evaluated by using oligonucleotide microarrays. Activation of transcription factors was evaluated by using an array of oligonucleotides encoding transcription factor binding sites. Responses were strongly influenced by coreceptor specificity. Treatment of cells from CCR5delta32 homozygous donors with glycoprotein (gp)120 derived from an R5 virus demonstrated that the majority of responses elicited by R5 envelopes required engagement of CCR5. R5 envelopes, to a greater extent than X4 envelopes, induced the expression of genes belonging to mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways and genes regulating the cell cycle. A number of genes induced by R5, but not X4, envelopes were also up-regulated in the resting CD4+ T cell population of HIV-infected individuals. These results suggest that R5 envelope facilitates replication of HIV in the pool of resting CD4+ T cells. Additionally, signaling by R5 gp120 may facilitate the transmission of R5 viruses by inducing a permissive environment for HIV replication.",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

As Src-family kinases activate the PI 3-kinase pathway in many cells [1], it is possible that the overexpression of Src, Lyn or Lck in HEK-293 cells induces the activation of PI 3-kinase, thereby promoting DAPP1 phosphorylation in unstimulated cells. As Src-family tyrosine kinases are located at the plasma membrane by virtue of myristoylation and palmitoylation of their N-termini [26], it is likely that the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is to recruit DAPP1 to the cell membrane, where it can be phosphorylated with Src-family tyrosine kinases.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

In CTLA-4-deficient mice, disease induction requires CD28 enhancement of TCR signaling by autoreactive TCR specificities with presumably high affinity for self-ligands, because disease induction is delayed by in vivo expression of transgenic TCRs with low affinity for self ligands (26, 27). Thus, we think that the importance of an intact Lck binding motif in the CD28 cytosolic tail for disease induction in CTLA-4-deficient mice reflects the fact that, by increasing the residency time of Lck in the immunological synapse, CD28 costimulation specifically increases the intensity and duration of in vivo TCR signaling by T cells with autoreactive TCR specificities.

We show that the CXCL16-CXCR6 chemokine-chemokine receptor axis regulated group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) diversity and function. CXCL16 was constitutively expressed by CX3CR1(+) intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and coexpressed with IL-23 after Citrobacter rodentium infection. Intestinal ILC3s expressed CXCR6 and its ablation generated a selective loss of the NKp46(+) ILC3 subset, a depletion of intestinal IL-22, and the inability to control C. rodentium infection. CD4(+) ILC3s were unaffected by CXCR6 deficiency and remained clustered within lymphoid follicles. In contrast, the lamina propria of Cxcr6(-/-) mice was devoid of ILC3s. The loss of ILC3-dependent IL-22 epithelial stimulation reduced antimicrobial peptide expression that explained the sensitivity of Cxcr6(-/-) mice to C. rodentium. Our results delineate a critical CXCL16-CXCR6 crosstalk that coordinates the intestinal topography of IL-22 secretion required for mucosal defense.",
