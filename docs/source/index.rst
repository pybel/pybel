PyBEL Documentation
===================
Biological Expression Language (BEL) is a domain-specific language that enables the expression of complex molecular
relationships and their context in a machine-readable form. Its simple grammar and expressive power have led to its
successful use in the to describe complex disease networks with several thousands of relationships.

PyBEL is a pure Python software package that parses BEL scripts, validates their semantics, and facilitates data
interchange between common formats and database systems like JSON, CSV, Excel, SQL, CX, and Neo4J. Its companion
package, `PyBEL-Tools <http://pybel-tools.readthedocs.io/>`_, contains a library of functions for analysis of
biological networks. For result-oriented guides, see the `PyBEL-Notebooks <https://github.com/pybel/pybel-notebooks>`_
repository.

Installation is as easy as getting the code from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybel>`_ with
:code:`python3 -m pip install pybel`
