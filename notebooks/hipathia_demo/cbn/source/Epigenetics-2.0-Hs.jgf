We therefore conclude that VSMC proliferation is regulated by β-catenin signaling, in part via the modulation of cyclin D1 and p21… β-catenin/TCF signaling regulates cyclin D1 reporter activity and mRNA levels",

RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and",

Knockdown of E2F-4 or Egr-1 inhibited CSE-induced LC3B expression. Knockdown of Egr-1 also inhibited the expression of Atg4B, a critical factor for LC3B conversion. Inhibition of autophagy by LC3B-knockdown protected epithelial cells from CSE-induced apoptosis.

Also, the involvement of transcription factors, Sp1 and Egr1, in the regulation of hsa-miR-106a expression and concomitant decrease in the IL-10 expression, has also been demonstrated. In summary, our results showed that IL-10 expression may be regulated by miR-106a, which is in turn transcriptionally regulated by Egr1 and Sp1.  ",

We cotransfected TOPFLASH or FOPFLASH, ?-catenin, and human wild-type Tcf-4 wild-type expression constructs into 293 cells. Optimized luciferase assays showed a basal level of TOP/FOP activity of between 4:1 and 20:1. Forty-eight hours after transfection, serum-starved 293 cells were treated with IGF-1 or insulin for 3 or 6 h. These factors alone failed to alter basal reporter activity (Fig. 6  b). A 16-h pretreatment of the transfectants with LiCl had a dramatic effect on reporter activity, with significant enhancement at 50 mM LiCl (P < 0.01 by Tukey's test for comparison with activity in the absence of LiCl). We saw a further increase in reporter activity when we added 50 ng/ml (6.5 nM) IGF-1 to transfectants pretreated with LiCl at 10 mM (P < 0.01 after 6 h of IGF-1 treatment) and at 50 mM (P < 0.01 after 3 h of IGF-1 treatment and P < 0.001 after 6 h).",

However, this increase was reduced to 1.5-fold in a dose-dependent manner, when full-length ANP32A or CRMP1 were coexpressed (Figure 6C).

We have previously reported that b-galactosidase expression from this Wnt reporter declines rapidly in airway epithelium after E11.5 (ref. 12). Notably, there was a pronounced increase in b-galactosidase expression in the airway epithelium of Gata6 flox/flox:Sftpc-cre mutants, indicating that Wnt–b-catenin signaling was upregulated in airway epithelium upon loss of Gata6 expression (Fig. 5c–h).",

Agarose gel analysis of PCR products showed that the TBE1 or TBE2 containing DNA was immunoprecipitated by anti-ß-catenin (Fig. 2C, lane B) or anti-Tcf-4 (Fig. 2C, lane T) antibodies, and only a weak background was observed by IgG (Fig. 2C, lane I). These evidences indicate that ß-catenin/Tcf-4 specifically binds to the NOS2 promoter TBE1 and TBE2 regions in vivo. Overexpression of beta-catenin and Tcf-4 significantly increased both basal and cytokine-induced NOS2 promoter activity (P < 0.01), and the induction was dependent on intact TBE sites. Transfection with control Tcf-4 (Fig. 4A, lane 1) or ß-catenin (Fig. 4A, lane 2) empty vectors did not induce NOS2 mRNA or protein, whereas induction of both endogenous mRNA and protein was observed with overexpression of Tcf-4 (Fig. 4A, lane 3) or ß-catenin (Fig. 4A, lane 4).

A critical serine phosphorylation site at amino acid 37 that ordinarily targets ß-catenin for degradation has been mutated (10) . Fig. 1D.  Citation  illustrates a linear dose response to the effects of ß-cateninS37A. The peak response was observed when 1.25 µg of expression vector was cotransfected with 0.75 µg of reporter vector, resulting in a >30-fold stimulation of VEGF promoter activity. In independent studies, HeLa cells were treated with 25 mM LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK-3ß kinase activity. GSK-3ß is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, and inhibiting GSK-3ß with LiCl resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in VEGF promoter activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that activation of Wnt signaling up-regulates VEGF expression in colonic neoplasia. (from full text) ",

Dkk3 is the only Dkk family member abundantly expressed in normal lung, but silenced by promoter hypermethylation in a large fraction of lung cancer cell lines and lung tumors. Downregulation of Dkk3 was correlated with tumor progression and expression of nuclear beta-catenin in lung tumors. Ectopic expression of Dkk3 in lung cancer cells with Dkk3 hypermethylation induced apoptosis and inhibited TCF-4 activity as well as nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and expression of TCF-4 targets c-Myc and cyclin D1. Furthermore, small interference RNA knock down of Dkk3 in cells lacking Dkk3 hypermethylation was sufficient to promote cell proliferation, beta-catenin nuclear translocation and expression of c-Myc. These observations suggested that epigenetic inactivation of Dkk3 activates the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, thereby promoting the growth of lung cancer cells.",

In the absence of TSA, follistatin transcription was initiated after 4 to 12 hr of culture in differentiation medium and steadily increased over the next 48 hr (Figure 2G, Control). While being consistently elevated in every sample of TSA-treated cells, the follistatin transcripts displayed two peaks at 4 and 48 hr (Figure 2G, TSA). The transcriptional profile of follistatin was independently analyzed by RT-PCR and found to be concordant with that observed using microarray analysis (Figure 2G, lower panel). VPA and sodium butyrate, another HDAC inhibitor, also increased follistatin expression (Figure 2H). To investigate whether HDAC inhibitors induce follistatin expression in a cell type-spe-cific manner, mouse primary keratinocytes, C2C12 cells (Figures 3A and 3B), and mouse primary myoblasts (Figures 3C and 3D) were exposed to either TSA, sodium butyrate, or VPA for 18 hr and induced to differentiate. HDAC inhibitors increased follistatin levels in C2C12 and primary myoblasts but not in keratinocytes, which also failed to upregulate follistatin during differentiation (Figures 3A to 3D). Similarly, HDAC inhibitors could not augment follistatin expression in C3H10T1/2 and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, as well as in the adipogenic 3T3-L1 and the osteogenic MC3T3-E1 cell lines (Figures 3E and 3F).",

RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and",

We show that the NPC RanBP2 protein functions as an E3 ligase for HDAC4, suggesting that sumoylation and nuclear import are coordinated events. An HDAC4 mutant, defective for SUMO-1 conjugation, exhibits lower transcriptional repressing and histone deacetylase activities, indicating that sumoylation might be important for full biological activity of HDAC4-containing complexes. Finally, we provide in vitro evidence that other HDACs and HDAC-related proteins are modified similarly by SUMO.",

However, when comparing non-CpG island methyl probes, the pattern was very different and the numbers of hyper- and hypo- methylated probes were evenly distributed (S1B Fig. and S4 Table).

To examine the potential role of epigenetic factors in these processes, we examined the relationship of smoking to genome wide methylation and gene expression using biomaterial from two independent samples, lymphoblast DNA and RNA (n = 119) and lung alveolar macrophage DNA (n = 19). We found that in both samples current smoking status was associated with significant changes in DNA methylation, in particular at the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR), a known tumor suppressor.",

Knockdown of E2F-4 or Egr-1 inhibited CSE-induced LC3B expression. Knockdown of Egr-1 also inhibited the expression of Atg4B, a critical factor for LC3B conversion. Inhibition of autophagy by LC3B-knockdown protected epithelial cells from CSE-induced apoptosis.

      "boundary_conditions": "The human model sets were built to represent healthy processes and were then enhanced with COPD data to represent early COPD (GOLD stage I and II) processes. If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. For a mechanism predicted from COPD data it was incorporated into a network with an edge based on COPD studies if available, and if not healthy context was used to incorporate these COPD mechanisms. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. We excluded cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, all virus infections, all bacterial infections, septic pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), allergic responses/asthma, pneumoconiosis, and COPD exacerbations. We also excluded animal inhalation studies with solid particles (titanium dioxide, quartz, asbestos, carbon black, diesel exhaust etc). For the in vitro-specific exclusion criteria we excluded tumor-derived cell lines, immortalized cell lines, neuronal cells, and cell types that cannot be found in the respiratory/vascular system. There were some exceptions where we included immortalized cell lines and non-lung cell types for canonical mechanisms where there was evidence that the relationship was not tissue-specific but could also take place in the lung. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available.",
