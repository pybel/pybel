Rho-family GTPases including Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA play central roles in controlling actin cytoskeletal dynamics (Hall, 1998Go). The activities of these proteins are tightly controlled during cell adhesion to the ECM (Hynes, 2002Go; Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002Go). For example, Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion and, via specific effectors, stimulate the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex leading to actin polymerisation and lamellipodia and filopodia formation at the leading edge of cells",

Using recombinant Rho GTPases and LyGDI, we demonstrate that PLCbeta2 is stimulated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S])-activated Cdc42HsxLyGDI, but not by RhoAxLyGDI. Stimulation of PLCbeta2, which was also observed for GTP[S]-activated recombinant Rac1, was independent of LyGDI, but required C-terminal processing of Cdc42Hs/Rac1. Cdc42Hs/Rac1 also stimulated PLCbeta2 in a system made up of purified recombinant proteins, suggesting that this function is mediated by direct protein-protein interaction.",

The results revealed that CXCL12-promoted migration of DN Rac or Vav1 SH3-SH2-SH3 transfectants was substantially lower than that displayed by transfectants expressing wt Rac, Vav1, or Cdc42, or DN Cdc42 (Figure 8Figure 8.). This migration was inhibited by anti-CXCR4 mAb (unpublished data), and by anti-?4 (Figure 8Figure 8.), indicating that was mediated by ?4?1.

Activation of the p38 MAPK cascade in Jurkat T cells has been shown to require phosphorylation of the GEF Vav by Zap-70 and subsequent activation of Rac-1. CD28 co-stimulation augments the recruitment of Vav to LAT and Zap-70 and increases Zap-70 mediated Vav phosphorylation [23].

Like vacuole formation, both of these latter processes are dependent on actin and microtubules (Greenberg, 1995; Davis and Camarillo, 1996; Cardelli, 2001). In addition, the inner surfaces of the pinocytosed membranes contain F-actin (Greenberg, 1995; Davis and Camarillo, 1996; Cardelli, 2001) (Fig. 11). Recent work has elucidated some of the molecular components involved in the cytoskeletal signaling pathways regulating macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. In both cases, Rho GTPases regulate these events. Rac and Cdc42 GTPases have been found to be required for macropinocytosis (Cardelli, 2001; Ridley, 2001a) and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis (Caron and Hall, 1998). Dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 markedly blocked EC vacuole and lumen formation in collagen and fibrin matrices, while dominant negative RhoA had no effect.",

Additional complexity in the system is provided by the contribution of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family, downstream effectors of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Isoforms PAK1 and PAK2 have both been shown to phosphorylate smooth muscle MLCK and decrease MLCK activity in cultured cells (61, 123), but whether PAK regulates the high-molecular-mass MLCK present in endothelium in this fashion is not clear. Conversely, PAK2 can directly phosphorylate MLC to produce EC contraction (163).",

D., Li, Y., Pong, R.-C., and Hsieh, J.-T. (1998) Endocrinology 139, 3542-3553). However, its mechanism of action is not understood completely. This study delineates the functional significance of DOC-2/DAB2 protein phosphorylation and demonstrates that in vivo activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces DOC-2/DAB2 phosphorylation, including a serine residue at position 24. Mutation of Ser(24) to Ala reduced DOC-2/DAB2 phosphorylation by PKC. Using a synthetic Ser(24) peptide (APS(24)KKEKKKGSEKTD) or recombinant DOC-2/DAB2 as substrates, PKCbetaII, PKCgamma, and PKCdelta (but not casein kinase II) directly phosphorylated Ser(24) in vitro. This indicates that DOC-2/DAB2 is a PKC-specific substrate. Since expression of wild-type DOC-2/DAB2, but not the S24A mutant, inhibited TPA-induced AP-1 activity in prostatic epithelial cells, phosphorylation of Ser(24) appears to play a critical role in modulating TPA-induced AP-1 activity. Taken together, these data suggest that PKC-regulated phosphorylation of DOC-2/DAB2 protein may help its growth inhibitory function.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a central pathway that transmits signals from many extracellular agents to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle progression. The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Understanding of these processes may provide a full picture of the distinct, and even opposing cellular processes that are regulated by the ERK cascade.",

              "summary_text": "MyD88 also interacts directly with AKT, and a dominant-negative mutant of AKT causes a defect in MyD88-dependent NF-kB transcriptional activity. However, the binding of NF-kB to DNA is not affected by inhibiting AKT, indicating that AKT might be involved in the phosphorylation of the p65 transactivation domain. A dominant-negative mutant of MyD88 was shown to block the kinase activity of AKT generated in response to LPS and IL-1, and a dominant-negative mutant of p85 inhibited the NF-kB activity elicited by LPS and IL-1 but not that elicited by TNF85. These findings indicate that PI3K is a positive mediator of the signalling induced by LPS and IL-1 that leads to NF-kB activation. However, recent studies using mice that lack the p85 regulatory subunit showed an increased production of IL-12 by DCs, possibly because of enhanced activation of the p38 MAPK, indicating that PI3K might have a negative role in TLR signalling in DCs86.  ECSIT. ECSIT has no homology with any known protein and was cloned as a TRAF6-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening87. ECSIT interacts with the conserved TRAF domain of TRAF6. A Drosophila homologue of ECSIT has been identified, and the interaction between TRAF6 and ECSIT is also conserved in Drosophila. ECSIT also interacts with MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase kinase 1), which can phosphorylate and activate the IKK complex. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ECSIT blocks signalling through TLR4, indicating that ECSIT might transduce TLR signals by bridging TRAF6 and the IKK complex. Furthermore, the inhibition of ECSIT expression, using siRNA in a macrophage cell line, resulted in impaired LPS-induced, but not TNF-induced, NF-kB activation88. The physiological function of ECSIT was studied by generating ECSIT-deficient mice, which were found to die on about embryonic day 7.5 (Ref. 88). Further characterization showed that ECSIT is an obligatory intermediate in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, and therefore ECSIT is an essential component in both the TLR- and BMP-signalling pathways.  SRC family of tyrosine kinases. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the SRC-related TEC-family of protein tyrosine kinases and has an essential role in B-cell development and B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signalling. Macrophages from X-linked-immunodeficient mice that lack BTK show reduced responses to LPS, and BTK has also been found to associate with the TIR domain of TLR4,TLR6, TLR8 and TLR9 (Ref. 89). It has also been shown to associate with MyD88, TIRAP and IRAK1, and to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to LPS, whereas a dominant-negative form of BTK inhibits LPS-induced activation of NF-kB, indicating that BTK is involved in the TLR-mediated signalling pathway. During BCR-mediated signalling, BTK interacts with and is activated by the SRC family of tyrosine kinases, such as FYN, LYN and haematopoietic-cell kinase, HCK; however, SRC-family kinases have only a minor role in LPS signalling90. Therefore, the involvement of BTK in TLR signalling needs to be further investigated.  MAPKKK. Members of the MAPKKK family - such as TAK1, MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, TPL2 (tumour-progression locus 2; also known as cancer Osaka thyroid, COT) and NIK - are implicated in IKK-NF-kB and MAPK activation. Among these members, MEKK3 has been shown to be involved in signalling through TLR4 but not through TLR9 (Ref. 91): in response to stimulation with a TLR4 ligand but not a TLR9 ligand, embryonic fibroblasts from MEKK3-deficient mice were shown to have impaired IL-6 production and defective activation of NF-kB, JNK and the p38 MAPK. Stimulation of TLR4 also induced association of MEKK3 with TRAF6. So, MEKK3 is involved in the TLR4-mediated signalling pathway. Another member of the MKKK family, TPL2 has been shown to be involved in the TLR4-mediated activation of ERK92. In response to TLR4 ligand, TPL2-deficient...",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

The ability of mRon to activate the MAP kinase pathway is dependent on c-Src activity, and we have shown that c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with mRon. c-Src fails to interact with mRon when the three tyrosines required for MAP kinase activation are mutated, whereas the presence of any one of these tyrosines alone restores Erk phosphorylation and recruitment of c-Src.",

              "summary_text": "The growth-stimulating effects of thrombin are mediated primarily via activation of a G protein-coupled receptor, PAR-1. Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

We observed that coexpression of oncogenic p21ras stimulated the transactivating activity of NF-IL6 and induced phosphorylation of Thr-235 located just N-terminal to the DNA binding domain of NF-IL6. Recently, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been shown to be implicated in the cellular response to activated ras. Purified MAP kinases specifically phosphorylated Thr-235 of NF-IL6 in vitro. Mutation of Thr-235 abolished the ras-dependent activation of NF-IL6. From these results, we conclude that NF-IL6 is regulated through phosphorylation by MAP kinases in response to activated ras.",

Little is known about how these differentiation factors suppress noradrenergic properties. We used sympathetic neurons and SK-N-BE(2)M17 neuroblastoma cells to investigate CDF down-regulation of the norepinephrine synthetic enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). LIF and CNTF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 but not p38 or Jun N-terminal kinases in both cell types. Preventing ERK activation with PD98059 blocked CNTF suppression of DBH protein in sympathetic neurons but did not prevent the loss of DBH mRNA. CNTF decreased transcription of a DBH promoter-luciferase reporter construct in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and this was also ERK-independent. Cytokine inhibition of DBH promoter activity did not require a silencer element but was prevented by overexpression of the transcriptional activator Phox2a. Inhibiting ERK activation increased basal DBH transcription in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and DBH mRNA in sympathetic neurons. Transfection of Phox2a into PD98059-treated M17 cells resulted in a synergistic increase in DBH promoter activity compared with Phox2a or PD98059 alone. These data suggest that CDFs down-regulate DBH protein via an ERK-dependent pathway but inhibit DBH gene expression through an ERK-independent pathway. They further suggest that ERK activity inhibits basal DBH gene expression.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Moreover, using an anti-T183P antibody, we showed that OA increased ERK2 phosphorylation by 400±133% (P<0.05) at OA concentrations of 200 nM (Fig. 2B,E). In contrast, in the presence of RGDS peptide, in conditions in which ?llb?3 was not engaged, no statistically significant variation in ERK2 activity or in levels of the phosphothreonine form of ERK2 (even at 200 nM OA) was observed ( Fig. 2A,B,F). Surprisingly, increasing the concentration of OA decreased the level of phosphorylation of the Y185 residue of ERK2 (halved at 200 nM OA) in the presence or absence of RGDS peptide (Fig. 2C,E,F). ",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

PI3K is positively regulated by RasGRP1 (61), in addition to being activated by Fyn. Mast cells from RasGRP1 knock-out mice show defects in multiple pathways downstream of PIP3, including reduced phosphorylation of Akt. This results in reduced degranulation and cytokine production upon Fc?RI activation of RasGRP1 knock-out",

Although precise mechanisms on cell-lineage-specific IL-5Ralpha expression remain elusive, several transcription factors including Sp1, E12/E47, Oct-2, and c/EBPbeta have been shown to regulate its expression in B cells and eosinophils. JAK2 and JAK1 tyrosine kinase are constitutively associated with IL-5Ralpha and betac, respectively, and are activated by IL-5 stimulation. IL-5 activates at least three different signaling pathways including JAK2/STAT5 pathway, Btk pathway, and Ras/ERK pathway.",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

In this report we demonstrate that the PTEN effect on HBx induced IGF-II activation in a hepatoma cell line. Expression of PTEN and IGF-II was inversely related in different hepatoma cell lines. PTEN expression induced decreased Sp1 DNA binding by dephosphorylating Sp1 and interfered with transcriptional transactivation of IGF-II by HBx in hepatoma cells. The protein phosphatase activity was involved in PTEN downregulation of IGF-II transcription through downregulation of MAPK, MAPK kinase phosphorylation and PKC translocation. Our data suggest that PTEN blocks Sp1 phosphorylation in response to HBx, by inactivating PKC, MAPK and MAPK kinase which eventually downregulate IGF-II expression, during the formation of HCC.",

              "summary_text": "Astrocytes in the central nervous system are involved in a variety of functions including storage of glycogen, maintenance of the extracellular ionic equilibrium, and support for the migration and the differentiation of neurons. Astrocytes express membrane receptors allowing them to respond to extracellular signals. Activation of receptors induces a cascade of events, such as stimulation of protein kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of target proteins. To understand the regulatory processes underlying neuroglial interactions, attempts were made to identify major phosphorylated proteins in striatal astrocytes, grown in primary culture and labeled with [32P]phosphate. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed a major doublet, Pa and Pb, of highly labeled spots, with a low molecular weight (M(r) = 15,000) and acidic pI (pI = 5.2 and 5.3, respectively). Using an enriched, heat-stable, cytosolic fraction, Pa and Pb were eluted from semi-preparative two-dimensional gels and subjected to a limited proteolysis and partial microsequencing. The same sequences were obtained within Pa and Pb and had no homology with other known protein. Antibodies raised against corresponding synthetic peptides confirm that the doublet represents two isoelectric variants of the same protein, which also exists under a nonphosphorylated form, N. We propose to name this protein PEA-15, for Phosphoprotein Enriched in Astrocytes-15 kDa, according to its large enrichment in these cells. Treatment of intact astrocytes with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which stimulates protein kinase C (PKC), increased the phosphorylation of the more acidic spot (Pb) while decreasing Pa intensity. Stimulations of astrocytes known to increase PKC activity, i.e. noradrenaline, or its inhibition by decreasing extracellular calcium concentrations, staurosporine, or desensitization following long term treatment with TPA, induced a phosphorylation or a dephosphorylation of PEA-15, respectively. Using purified PKC, PEA-15 appeared to be a good substrate in vitro. Two-dimensional peptide mapping revealed that the phosphorylation site in intact cells was identical with the site phosphorylated by PKC in vitro. Mapping the phosphopeptides by HPLC following endolysine C treatment lead to the identification of a sequence, phosphorylated in intact astrocytes and in vitro by PKC, containing a consensus site for PKC: LTRIPSAKK. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide derived from this sequence recognized N and Pa in control conditions and Pb after its dephosphorylation. Thus, PEA-15 is an endogenous substrate for PKC, the kinase mediating the transition from Pa to Pb.",

Staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) that was initially isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces. Cell cycle arrest was observed upon staurosporine treatment in both normal and transformed cells. Staurosporine induced G1 cell cycle arrest at low nanomolar concentrations, and cellular apoptosis was observed at higher concentrations. The 7-hydroxy analogue of staurosporine, UCN-01, was subsequently identified as a more potent and selective inhibitor of PKC. In several cell lines, UCN-01 inhibited cellular growth and induced apoptosis, correlating with the activation of CDK1 and CDK2. The observation that GF10923X, an even more selective PKC antagonist than UCN-01, inhibited PKC activity but did not inhibit growth, suggested that the CDK activation by UCN-01 may have contributed to its cellular apoptotic effects. Interestingly, UCN-01 inhibits CDC2 and CDK2 in vitro, and it activates these same enzymes in intact cells (reviewed in [64]).",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Traditionally, it is thought that mast cells bound to Ag-specific Fc?RI, so-called sensitized mast cells, encounter multivalent Ag, and then IgE-bound receptors are aggregated or cross-linked, leading to cell activation (1). Activated mast cells secrete preformed and newly synthesized proinflammatory mediators involved in inflammatory processes of allergy, such as histamine, proteases, lipids, cytokines, and chemokines. The mouse Fc?RI consists of an IgE-binding ? subunit, a signal-amplifying {beta} subunit, and disulfide-bonded two molecules of signal-generating ? subunit (2). Fc?RI aggregation leads to the activation of {beta} subunit-bound Lyn, a prominent Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)3 in mast cells (3). Lyn phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs of the {beta} and ? subunits (4). Phosphorylated ITAMs of {beta} and ? subunits, respectively, recruit Lyn and Syk, a member of another PTK family with two tandemly arranged Src homology 2 domains, leading to the activation of these PTKs. Active Lyn and Syk phosphorylate numerous cellular target proteins, leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K and phospholipase C (PLC)-?. An alternative pathway involving Fyn (another Src family PTK) was shown to activate PI3K (5). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, i.e., diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and then Ca2+ influx. Increased DAG and Ca2+ lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (reviewed in Ref. 6). Both PKC and Ca2+ are required for optimal degranulation (7). ",

We compared the in vitro phosphorylation of purified IP(3)R1 and IP(3)R3 by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase C (PKC). Phosphorylation of IP(3)R1 by PKC was about eight times stronger than that of IP(3)R3 under identical conditions. Protein kinase A strongly stimulated the PKC-induced phosphorylation of IP(3)R1. In contrast, Ca(2+) inhibited its phosphorylation (IC(50)<or=2microM) and this inhibition was further potentiated by calmodulin (CaM), while the Ca(2+)-independent CaM mutant CaM(1234) was ineffective. Ca(2+) and CaM, however, did not inhibit IP(3)R3 phosphorylation by PKC. Taken together, these findings show that Ca(2+) and CaM differentially regulate the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of IP(3)R1 and IP(3)R3 and are indicative for a role for the inhibition of IP(3)R1 phosphorylation by Ca(2+) and CaM in the negative slope of the bell-shaped effect of Ca(2+) on IP(3)R function.",

              "summary_text": "Mast cells are the major effector cell type in IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity. Traditionally, it is thought that mast cells bound to Ag-specific Fc?RI, so-called sensitized mast cells, encounter multivalent Ag, and then IgE-bound receptors are aggregated or cross-linked, leading to cell activation (1). Activated mast cells secrete preformed and newly synthesized proinflammatory mediators involved in inflammatory processes of allergy, such as histamine, proteases, lipids, cytokines, and chemokines. The mouse Fc?RI consists of an IgE-binding ? subunit, a signal-amplifying {beta} subunit, and disulfide-bonded two molecules of signal-generating ? subunit (2). Fc?RI aggregation leads to the activation of {beta} subunit-bound Lyn, a prominent Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)3 in mast cells (3). Lyn phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs of the {beta} and ? subunits (4). Phosphorylated ITAMs of {beta} and ? subunits, respectively, recruit Lyn and Syk, a member of another PTK family with two tandemly arranged Src homology 2 domains, leading to the activation of these PTKs. Active Lyn and Syk phosphorylate numerous cellular target proteins, leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K and phospholipase C (PLC)-?. An alternative pathway involving Fyn (another Src family PTK) was shown to activate PI3K (5). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, i.e., diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and then Ca2+ influx. Increased DAG and Ca2+ lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (reviewed in Ref. 6). Both PKC and Ca2+ are required for optimal degranulation (7). ",

We show that the kinase domains of FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4 containing the activation loop mutation, when targeted to the plasma membrane by a myristylation signal, can transform NIH3T3 cells and induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Phosphorylation of Shp2, PLC-gamma, and MAPK was also stimulated by all three 'TDII-like' FGFR derivatives. Additionally, activation of Stat1 and Stat3 was observed in cells expressing the activated FGFR derivatives. Finally, we demonstrate that FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4 derivatives can stimulate PI-3 kinase activity. ",

Among the p160/steroid receptor co-activators, only p/CIP (nuclear co-activator 3) has been shown to be up-regulated by interleukin (IL)-4 in B cells through a STAT-6-dependent mechanism using Gene-Chip analysis. In this study, we have investigated the function of p/CIP in the transcriptional activation by STAT6. We found that p/CIP indirectly interacted with STAT6 via p300, and overexpression of the CBP-interacting domain of p/CIP (p/CIP(947-1084)) prevented the interaction of p/CIP with STAT6 by blocking the binding of p/CIP to p300. Whereas expression of p/CIP(947-1084) resulted in a marked reduction of STAT6-mediated transactivation, overexpression of wild type p/CIP resulted in significant enhancement of it. In addition, p/CIP(947-1084) markedly reduced CD23 expression on B cells stimulated with IL-4, whereas overexpression of wild type p/CIP enhanced it. Chromatin immunoprecipitations demonstrate that IL-4 increases the interaction of p/CIP with the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain germ line epsilon promoter in B cells. These results suggest that p/CIP positively regulates STAT6 transcriptional activation through formation of a STAT6, p300/CBP, and p/CIP complex.",

              "summary_text": "Mast cells are the major effector cell type in IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity. Traditionally, it is thought that mast cells bound to Ag-specific Fc?RI, so-called sensitized mast cells, encounter multivalent Ag, and then IgE-bound receptors are aggregated or cross-linked, leading to cell activation (1). Activated mast cells secrete preformed and newly synthesized proinflammatory mediators involved in inflammatory processes of allergy, such as histamine, proteases, lipids, cytokines, and chemokines. The mouse Fc?RI consists of an IgE-binding ? subunit, a signal-amplifying {beta} subunit, and disulfide-bonded two molecules of signal-generating ? subunit (2). Fc?RI aggregation leads to the activation of {beta} subunit-bound Lyn, a prominent Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)3 in mast cells (3). Lyn phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs of the {beta} and ? subunits (4). Phosphorylated ITAMs of {beta} and ? subunits, respectively, recruit Lyn and Syk, a member of another PTK family with two tandemly arranged Src homology 2 domains, leading to the activation of these PTKs. Active Lyn and Syk phosphorylate numerous cellular target proteins, leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K and phospholipase C (PLC)-?. An alternative pathway involving Fyn (another Src family PTK) was shown to activate PI3K (5). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, i.e., diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and then Ca2+ influx. Increased DAG and Ca2+ lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (reviewed in Ref. 6). Both PKC and Ca2+ are required for optimal degranulation (7). ",

This leads to the autophosphorylation of Kit on tyrosine and its association with substrates of various kinds. The phophatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt system is one of the major pathways [33] (fig. 1). PI3K is composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. The 85-kDa regulatory subunit is associated with activated Kit through an SH2 domain, and then is phosphorylated on tyrosine. The 110-kDa catalytic subunit of the activated PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, which in turn is used for phosphorylation of Akt, a serine-threonine kinase. The activated Akt is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis of cells whose survival depends on Kit signaling. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate blocks not only autophosphorylation of Kit but also phosphorylation of Akt [34]. Induction of apoptosis in Kit signaling-dependent cells by imatinib mesylate may be mediated through the inhibition of Akt activity.",

As Src-family kinases activate the PI 3-kinase pathway in many cells [1], it is possible that the overexpression of Src, Lyn or Lck in HEK-293 cells induces the activation of PI 3-kinase, thereby promoting DAPP1 phosphorylation in unstimulated cells. As Src-family tyrosine kinases are located at the plasma membrane by virtue of myristoylation and palmitoylation of their N-termini [26], it is likely that the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is to recruit DAPP1 to the cell membrane, where it can be phosphorylated with Src-family tyrosine kinases.",

Traditionally, it is thought that mast cells bound to Ag-specific Fc?RI, so-called sensitized mast cells, encounter multivalent Ag, and then IgE-bound receptors are aggregated or cross-linked, leading to cell activation (1). Activated mast cells secrete preformed and newly synthesized proinflammatory mediators involved in inflammatory processes of allergy, such as histamine, proteases, lipids, cytokines, and chemokines. The mouse Fc?RI consists of an IgE-binding ? subunit, a signal-amplifying {beta} subunit, and disulfide-bonded two molecules of signal-generating ? subunit (2). Fc?RI aggregation leads to the activation of {beta} subunit-bound Lyn, a prominent Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)3 in mast cells (3). Lyn phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs of the {beta} and ? subunits (4). Phosphorylated ITAMs of {beta} and ? subunits, respectively, recruit Lyn and Syk, a member of another PTK family with two tandemly arranged Src homology 2 domains, leading to the activation of these PTKs. Active Lyn and Syk phosphorylate numerous cellular target proteins, leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K and phospholipase C (PLC)-?. An alternative pathway involving Fyn (another Src family PTK) was shown to activate PI3K (5). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, i.e., diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and then Ca2+ influx. Increased DAG and Ca2+ lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (reviewed in Ref. 6). Both PKC and Ca2+ are required for optimal degranulation (7). ",

Furthermore, Lyn, but not Jak2, phosphorylated CrkL on tyrosine in in vitro kinase assays. Together, the present study suggests that, upon Epo stimulation, CrkL is recruited to the EpoR through interaction between the CrkL SH2 domain and phosphorylated Tyr(460) in the EpoR cytoplasmic domain and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by receptor-associated Lyn to activate the downstream signaling pathway leading to the activation of Erk and Elk-1.",

To further characterize IL-4 effects on B cells, we used a sensitive PCR-based subtraction approach to isolate genes expressed in IL-4 treated cells. Our approach combined an adaptation of the genomic representational difference analysis (RDA) method to cDNA analysis with a physical separation method (magnetic bead depletion). This cDNA RDA technique allowed us to perform subtraction on the relatively small number of highly, characterized, purified B cells that can be conveniently prepared. In the hopes of removing genes responsible for general cell growth, we subtracted cDNA made from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated B cells from cDNA from LPS+IL-4 stimulated B cells. Two rounds of subtraction resulted in greater than 100-fold enhancement of expected IL-4-induced Cgamma1 cDNA. At that point, we cloned this subtraction library and analysed 154 randomly picked clones for sequence similarities. From these clones, 37 individual genes were obtained. Most of these genes (30) could be functionally identified by sequence similarity. These included genes encoding Cgamma1 (1), cytoskeletal components (4) and products involved in DNA replication (3), metabolism (5), signal transduction (4), transcription (4), translation (6) and transport (3). Only 7 genes had no similarity to known sequences in the GenBank, EMBL or Swiss Prot databases. One unknown gene (designated Fig1 for IL-Four Induced Gene 1) and one gene with homology to the human transcription factor E4BP4 were confirmed by Northern blot analysis to be induced 10-20-fold by IL-4 treatment. This list of expressed genes in LPS + IL-4 treated B cells may shed further insight on the action and mechanism of IL-4 stimulation of cells.",
