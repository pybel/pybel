Both of these putative promoters were responsive to the osteoclast-inducing cytokine, receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and demonstrated trans-activation by the RANKL-induced transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1), consistent with a role in regulating CTR gene expression in osteoclasts.",

              "summary_text": "This, in turn, would lead to activation of the CREB and MEF2 proteins, which then would bind to and potentially activate the PGC-1-alpha promoter. Of course, MEF2 bound to the PGC-1-alpha promoter is also a target for PGC-1-alpha  coactivation, resulting in a stable, feed-forward regulatory loop. A key feature of this model is that PGC-1-alpha  should be a regulator of its own expression in skeletal muscle. To critically test this hypothesis, we examined whether ectopic PGC-1-alpha  expressed in the muscle of transgenic mice activates expression of the endogenous PGC-1-alpha  gene. Real-time PCR primers were designed for the PGC-1-alpha  3 untranslated region that allows for determination of the levels of ectopically expressed and endogenous PGC-1-alpha . As shown in Fig. 4B and as expected, ectopic PGC-1-alpha  is detected only in the muscle of transgenic mice. Strikingly, a 7-fold elevation of endogenous PGC-1-alpha mRNA was seen in the transgenic animals as compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 4B). A robust increase in the transcript levels of cytochrome c and myoglobin also was observed in the RNA isolated from skeletal muscle of the transgenic mice, whereas GAPDH transcript levels remained unchanged (Fig. 4B). These results indicate a regulation of PGC-1-alpha transcription by PGC-1-alpha  protein in an apparent autoregulatory loop. As a second critical test of our proposed model, we examined whether inhibiting MEF2 andor CREB activity in transfections can decrease the transcription of the PGC-1-alpha  promoter stimulated by CaMKIV, CnA, and PGC-1-alpha . To do this, we used a previously characterized dominant-negative allele of MEF2C in addition to ACREB (26). As shown in Fig. 5A, dnMEF2C reduces the effects of the combination of CnA and CaMKIV, and completely eliminates the effect of PGC-1-alpha on the PGC-1-alpha Fig. 2. PGC-1-alpha  coactivates MEF2s on the PGC-1-alpha  promoter. (A) MEF2C and MEF2D activate the mouse PGC-1-alpha promoter. C2C12 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for MEF2C, MEF2D, NFAT, and PGC-1-alpha together with reporter gene plasmids containing 2 kb of the mouse PGC-1-alpha promoter. After 48 h, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was determined. (B) MEF2 activity is increased by CnA. C2C12 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids for MEF2C, MEF2D, NFAT, CnA, and PGC-1-alpha together with reporter gene plasmids containing 6 kb of the mouse PGC-1-alpha promoter. After 48 h, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was determined. The values represent the average of three independent experiments, and bars represent SD. *, P 0.5 between different treatments compared with the untreated control. promoter. In contrast, the dominant-negative allele of CREB (ACREB) reduces the activation by CnA and CaMKIV but does not affect the relative fold activation by PGC-1-alpha . The effects of MEF2C, PGC-1-alpha , and dnMEF2C on the expression of endogenous PGC-1-alpha  mRNA and on other fiber type-I specific genes also were examined. C2C12 cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding GFP, PGC-1-alpha , MEF2C, and dnMEF2C in various combinations. Subsequently, gene expression levels were determined by using real-time PCR. Levels of endogenous PGC-1-alpha  mRNA were elevated only slightly in cells infected with PGC-1-alpha  alone, and no induction was observed when MEF2C alone was expressed (Fig. 5B). In contrast, a large induction of endogenous PGC-1-alpha  mRNA (4-fold) was seen in cells that received a combination of PGC-1-alpha and MEF2C. The induction of endogenous PGC-1-alpha  mRNA could be blocked completely by coexpression of dnMEF2C. In all cases, similar amounts of the virally expressed PGC-1-alpha  and MEF2C mRNAs were observed (data not shown). Expression of myoglobin in C2C12 myotubes also required infection of both PGC-1-alpha  and MEF2C (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, induction of two other genes that are highly expr...",

Here, we examine the role of NFATC2 in skeletal muscle by analyzing adult NFATC2(-/)- mice. These mice exhibit reduced muscle size due to a decrease in myofiber cross-sectional area, suggesting that growth is blunted. Muscle growth was examined during regeneration after injury, wherein NFATC2-null myofibers form normally but display impaired growth. The growth defect is intrinsic to muscle cells, since the lack of NFATC2 in primary muscle cultures results in reduced cell size and myonuclear number in myotubes. Retroviral-mediated expression of NFATC2 in the mutant cells rescues this cellular phenotype. Myonuclear number is similarly decreased in NFATC2(-/)- mice. Taken together, these results implicate a novel role for NFATC2 in skeletal muscle growth. We demonstrate that during growth of multinucleated muscle cells, myoblasts initially fuse to form myotubes with a limited number of nuclei and that subsequent nuclear addition and increases in myotube size are controlled by a molecular pathway regulated by NFATC2.",

Similarly, DSCR1115-197, the truncated version of DSCR1 that retained CaNA binding activity, was able to act as a dose-dependent inhibitor, though not as efficiently as DSCR1 full-length. In contrast, co-expression of DSCR11-156, the mutant incapable of CaNA binding, had no effect on the activation assay, strongly suggesting that the inhibition caused by DSCR1 is mediated through calcineurin binding. ZAKI-4 was also able to inhibit calcineurin function, as measured by its ability to suppress IL-2 reporter activation (Fig. 5A).",

The CyPA-CsA complex binds to a composite surface formed by the catalytic and regulatory subunits of CN, where the complex of FK506 and its binding protein FKBP also binds. While the majority of the CN residues involved in the binding are common for both immunophilin-immunosuppressant complexes, a significant number of the residues are distinct. Unlike FKBP-FK506, CyPA-CsA interacts with Arg-122 at the active site of CN, implying direct involvement of CyPA-CsA in the regulation of CN catalysis. The simultaneous interaction of CyPA with both the composite surface and the active site of CN suggests that the composite surface may serve as a substrate recognition site responsible for the narrow substrate specificity of CN. The comparison of CyPA-CsA-CN with FKBP-FK506-CN significantly contributes to understanding the molecular basis of regulation of CN activity by the immunophilin-immunosuppressant.",

In parallel experiments, in which the fibers were stained with antibody directed against total CaMKII, there was no difference in mean nuclear antibody stain between stimulated and unstimulated fibers (P greater than 0.05; Fig. 3 A). These results are consistent with activation of nuclear CaMKII by fiber electrical stimulation without any appreciable translocation of CaMKII from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.",

Although cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were more abundant in the cytoplasmic fraction after partial hepatectomy, kinase activity was detected primarily in the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were activated by recombinant cyclin H/Cdk7.

Here, we discuss interconnecting signaling pathways controlled by RB and p53, attempting to explain their potentially universal involvement in the etiology of cancer.

As shown in Figure 5, wortmannin used at nanomolar concentrations specific for PI 3-kinase inhibition (Arcaro and Wymann, 1993), reduced the human endothelial cells migration induced by VEGF-A165. To determine whether beta3 integrin interferes in PI 3-kinase activation occurring after VEGFR-2 stimulation, we evaluated the effect of BV4 (anti-beta3 subunit mAb) on the phosphorylation in tyrosine residues of the p85 subunit and on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. After pre-incubation with BV4 or with anti-VEGFR-2 Ab for 20 min at 4°C, cells were stimulated with VEGF-A165. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 mAb, and the separated proteins by SDS–PAGE were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. VEGF-A165 increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, but it failed to phosphorylate the PI 3-kinase subunit when endothelial cells were pre-incubated with anti-beta3 or anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies (Figure 6).",

Consistent with a major role for hypoxia in the overall process, a large number of genes involved in different steps of angiogenesis are independently responsive to hypoxia in tissue culture. Examples include nitric oxide synthases involved in governing vascular tone, growth factors such as VEGF, angiopoietins, fibroblast growth factors and their various receptors, and genes involved in matrix metabolism, including matrix metalloproteinases, plasminogen activator receptors and inhibitors, and collagen prolyl hydroxylase16, 17, 18, 19, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 (Table 1). Similarly, many of the individual phenotypic processes in angiogenesis such as cell migration or endothelial tube formation can be induced by hypoxic tissue culture62, 63, 64. These analyses in isolated systems have sometimes apparently shown both positive and negative effects of hypoxia, for instance on endothelial proliferation65, 66, 67. It is not yet clear whether such phenomena reflect fundamentally different responses based on severity of hypoxia, or counter-regulatory controls that are normally integrated in a productive way.",

Over the past years, this concept has been repeatedly proven in animal studies, either by interfering with positive regulators of angiogenesis or by taking advantage of negative regulators of angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown to be the central positive regulator of tumor angiogenesis and, therefore, has become the primary target when exploiting anti-angiogenic strategies. As a result, both antibodies and inhibitors specifically directed against VEGF or its receptor VEGFR-2 have been raised and have been demonstrated to potently prevent vascularization and growth of a large number of experimental tumor types (1-4).",

Consistent with a major role for hypoxia in the overall process, a large number of genes involved in different steps of angiogenesis are independently responsive to hypoxia in tissue culture. Examples include nitric oxide synthases involved in governing vascular tone, growth factors such as VEGF, angiopoietins, fibroblast growth factors and their various receptors, and genes involved in matrix metabolism, including matrix metalloproteinases, plasminogen activator receptors and inhibitors, and collagen prolyl hydroxylase16, 17, 18, 19, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 (Table 1). Similarly, many of the individual phenotypic processes in angiogenesis such as cell migration or endothelial tube formation can be induced by hypoxic tissue culture62, 63, 64. These analyses in isolated systems have sometimes apparently shown both positive and negative effects of hypoxia, for instance on endothelial proliferation65, 66, 67. It is not yet clear whether such phenomena reflect fundamentally different responses based on severity of hypoxia, or counter-regulatory controls that are normally integrated in a productive way.",

As shown in Figure 5, wortmannin used at nanomolar concentrations specific for PI 3-kinase inhibition (Arcaro and Wymann, 1993), reduced the human endothelial cells migration induced by VEGF-A165. To determine whether beta3 integrin interferes in PI 3-kinase activation occurring after VEGFR-2 stimulation, we evaluated the effect of BV4 (anti-beta3 subunit mAb) on the phosphorylation in tyrosine residues of the p85 subunit and on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. After pre-incubation with BV4 or with anti-VEGFR-2 Ab for 20 min at 4°C, cells were stimulated with VEGF-A165. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 mAb, and the separated proteins by SDS–PAGE were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. VEGF-A165 increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, but it failed to phosphorylate the PI 3-kinase subunit when endothelial cells were pre-incubated with anti-beta3 or anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies (Figure 6).",

We hypothesized that signaling through G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptors may stimulate cytokine production. To test this hypothesis, a human mast cell line (HMC-1) that normally expresses receptors for complement components C3a and C5a at low levels was stably transfected to express physiologic levels of fMLP receptors. We found that fMLP, but not C3a or C5a, induced macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1ss (CCL4) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2) mRNA and protein. Although fMLP stimulated both sustained Ca(2+) mobilization and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), these responses to C3a or C5a were transient. However, transient expression of C3a receptors in HMC-1 cells rendered the cells responsive to C3a for sustained Ca(2+) mobilization and MIP-1ss production. The fMLP-induced chemokine production was blocked by pertussis toxin, PD98059, and cyclosporin A, which respectively inhibit G(i)alpha activation, mitgen-activated protein kinase kinase-mediated ERK phosphorylation, and calcineurin-mediated activation of NFAT. Furthermore, fMLP, but not C5a, stimulated NFAT activation in HMC-1 cells. These data indicate that chemoattractant receptors induce chemokine production in HMC-1 cells with a selectivity that depends on the level of receptor expression, the length of their signaling time, and the synergistic interaction of multiple signaling pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, sustained Ca(2+) mobilization and NFAT activation.",

      "boundary_conditions": "The human model sets were built to represent healthy processes and were then enhanced with COPD data to represent early COPD (GOLD stage I and II) processes. If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. For a mechanism predicted from COPD data it was incorporated into a network with an edge based on COPD studies if available, and if not healthy context was used to incorporate these COPD mechanisms. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. We excluded cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, all virus infections, all bacterial infections, septic pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), allergic responses/asthma, pneumoconiosis, and COPD exacerbations. We also excluded animal inhalation studies with solid particles (titanium dioxide, quartz, asbestos, carbon black, diesel exhaust etc). For the in vitro-specific exclusion criteria we excluded tumor-derived cell lines, immortalized cell lines, neuronal cells, and cell types that cannot be found in the respiratory/vascular system. There were some exceptions where we included immortalized cell lines and non-lung cell types for canonical mechanisms where there was evidence that the relationship was not tissue-specific but could also take place in the lung. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available.",
