If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

All Raf kinases are composed of three conserved regions, CR1 (adjacent to the amino terminus), CR2, and CR3 (adjacent to the carboxyl terminus). The regulation of Raf kinase activity is a complex process involving phosphorylation of the regulatory and catalytic domains of the protein and both inter- and intramolecular interactions. The initial process of Raf activation involves the interaction of active GTP-bound Ras with the RBD of Raf and the adjacent zinc-binding cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of CR1, facilitating recruitment of Raf to the cell membrane for activation.78 The role of CR2, which is rich in serine and threonine residues, is less well defined; however, the phosphorylation of moieities within CR2 and various proteinprotein interactions involving CR2 also affect Raf localization and activation.89,119-121 Deletions of the amino-terminal regulatory domains CR1 and CR2, similar to v-Raf, are found in several types of human cancers with activating Raf mutations, suggesting that these domains negatively regulate Raf function. CR3, the catalytic domain of Raf, is also subject to regulation by phosphorylation. Regulation of Raf Kinase Activity General. The overlapping functional aspects of the three Raf isoforms have been elucidated by studies involving Raf knockout mice. In C-Raf knockouts, B-Raf can compensate for the loss of C-Raf in activating MEK in the MAPK pathway, but C-Raf knockouts are much more susceptible to apoptotic stimuli, despite the presence of A-Raf and B-Raf.122 With regard to differences in signaling between the Raf isoforms, A-Raf is a weaker activator of MEK than B-Raf or C-Raf. Furthermore, A-Raf can activate MEK1 only, whereas C-Raf activates both MEK1 and MEK2.123-125",

IL-5 receptor (IL-5R) comprises alpha and betac chains. IL-5 specifically binds to IL-5Ralpha and induces the recruitment of betac to IL-5R. Although precise mechanisms on cell-lineage-specific IL-5Ralpha expression remain elusive, several transcription factors including Sp1, E12/E47, Oct-2, and c/EBPbeta have been shown to regulate its expression in B cells and eosinophils. JAK2 and JAK1 tyrosine kinase are constitutively associated with IL-5Ralpha and betac, respectively, and are activated by IL-5 stimulation. IL-5 activates at least three different signaling pathways including JAK2/STAT5 pathway, Btk pathway, and Ras/ERK pathway.",

In addition, neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibodies reduced 15(S)-HETE-induced HRMVEC migration and tube formation and Matrigel plug angiogenesis. Cloning and Transfac analysis of IL-8 promoter revealed the presence of 1 putative STAT-binding sequence at -476 nt, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed the binding of STAT-5B to this site in response to 15(S)-HETE.

Interestingly, it was located in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B (STAT5B) binding consensus site.

In vitro, we showed that the -681G allele completely abolished the binding of STAT5B to the cognate promoter element as well as the transactivation of the PPARgamma3 promoter by the growth hormone/STAT5B pathway.",

Through the use of cell lines each lacking an individual JAK, we find that in contrast to interferon signaling, PDGF-induced JAK phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 and STAT3 is independent of the presence of any other single JAK but does require receptor tyrosine kinase activity.",

Using recombinant Rho GTPases and LyGDI, we demonstrate that PLCbeta2 is stimulated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S])-activated Cdc42HsxLyGDI, but not by RhoAxLyGDI. Stimulation of PLCbeta2, which was also observed for GTP[S]-activated recombinant Rac1, was independent of LyGDI, but required C-terminal processing of Cdc42Hs/Rac1. Cdc42Hs/Rac1 also stimulated PLCbeta2 in a system made up of purified recombinant proteins, suggesting that this function is mediated by direct protein-protein interaction.",

A recent report suggests that Rho/Rho kinase and MLCK may differentially regulate MLC phosphorylation according to spatial localization within cultured cells (144). Additional complexity in the system is provided by the contribution of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family, downstream effectors of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Isoforms PAK1 and PAK2 have both been shown to phosphorylate smooth muscle MLCK and decrease MLCK activity in cultured cells (61, 123), but whether PAK regulates the high-molecular-mass MLCK present in endothelium in this fashion is not clear. Conversely, PAK2 can directly phosphorylate MLC to produce EC contraction (163).",

Among the p160/steroid receptor co-activators, only p/CIP (nuclear co-activator 3) has been shown to be up-regulated by interleukin (IL)-4 in B cells through a STAT-6-dependent mechanism using Gene-Chip analysis. In this study, we have investigated the function of p/CIP in the transcriptional activation by STAT6. We found that p/CIP indirectly interacted with STAT6 via p300, and overexpression of the CBP-interacting domain of p/CIP (p/CIP(947-1084)) prevented the interaction of p/CIP with STAT6 by blocking the binding of p/CIP to p300. Whereas expression of p/CIP(947-1084) resulted in a marked reduction of STAT6-mediated transactivation, overexpression of wild type p/CIP resulted in significant enhancement of it. In addition, p/CIP(947-1084) markedly reduced CD23 expression on B cells stimulated with IL-4, whereas overexpression of wild type p/CIP enhanced it. Chromatin immunoprecipitations demonstrate that IL-4 increases the interaction of p/CIP with the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain germ line epsilon promoter in B cells. These results suggest that p/CIP positively regulates STAT6 transcriptional activation through formation of a STAT6, p300/CBP, and p/CIP complex.",

The early rate of decay was similar in the presence or absence of MG132, an inhibitor of the proteasome, but the later rate of decay was decreased 5-fold.

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Holbro and N.E. Hynes, unpublished data). As a consequence, these cells have decreased PI-3K/PKB signaling, a reduction in D-type cyclin levels, and show an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A main effector of ErbB signaling, the PI-3K/PKB pathway, is particularly important in mediating cell survival 103 T. Holbro et al. / Experimental Cell Research 284 (2003) 99-110 since several PKB substrates directly control various apoptotic processes. The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

Furthermore, it is shown that Nhlh2 binds to E-box motifs found adjacent to STAT3 sites in the PC1/3 promoter both in vitro and in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, two different protein-protein interaction assays confirm the presence of a STAT3:Nhlh2 heterodimer on the PC1/3 promoter. The Nhlh2:STAT3 heterodimer may be an important transcriptional regulator of other hypothalamic genes in the leptin signaling pathway.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha has defined proinflammatory roles in Crohn's disease but its role in fibrosis is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that TNFalpha increases collagen accumulation and proliferation in intestinal myofibroblasts and has additive effects in combination with insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I. The mechanisms, TNF receptor isoform, and downstream signaling pathways were examined. Intestinal myofibroblasts from wild-type (WT) mice or mice homozygous for disruption of genes encoding TNFR1 (TNFR1-/-), TNFR2 (TNFR2-/-), or both (TNFR1/2-/-), were treated with TNFalpha, IGF-I, or both. In WT cells, TNFalpha and IGF-I stimulated type I collagen accumulation and DNA synthesis in an additive manner. IGF-I, but not TNFalpha, stimulated type I collagen gene activation. TNFalpha, but not IGF-I, induced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) expression and reduced matrix metalloproteinases-2 activity and collagen degradation. TNFalpha also activated ERK1/2. These responses to TNFalpha were absent in TNFR2-/- and TNFR1/2-/- myofibroblasts, whereas TNFR1-/- cells showed similar responses to WT. Inhibition of ERK1/2 diminished TNFalpha induced DNA synthesis in WT and TNFR1-/- cells. Differences in TNFalpha-induced STAT3/DNA binding activity and not NFkappaB and AP-1 transcriptional activation correlated with impaired collagen accumulation/TIMP-1 induction in TNFR2(-/-) cells. Constitutively active STAT3 rescued TIMP-1 expression in TNFR2-/- cells. We conclude that TNFalpha and IGF-I may additively contribute to fibrosis during intestinal inflammation. TNFR2 is a primary mediator of fibrogenic actions of TNFalpha acting through ERK1/2 to stimulate proliferation and through STAT3 to stimulate TIMP-1 and inhibit collagen degradation.",

In addition, the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) mRNAs, but not of interleukin 6 receptor mRNA, was up-regulated after systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment. Because these receptors are upstream of STAT3, the present results suggest that cytokines such as LIF and/or CNTF induce SPI-3 expression via STAT3 in the pineal gland in response to inflammatory stimulus. We conclude that although the functional consequences of SPI-3 in the pineal gland during systemic inflammation are unknown, SPI-3 may have a crucial role in preventing some degenerative proteolysis induced by inflammatory stimuli.",

              "summary_text": "Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is primarily known for its roles as a lesion factor released by the ruptured glial cells that prevent neuronal degeneration. However, CNTF has also been shown to cause weight loss in a variety of rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes, whereas a modified form also causes weight loss in humans. CNTF administration can correct or improve hyperinsulinemia, hyperphagia, and hyperlipidemia associated with these models of obesity. In order to investigate the effects of CNTF on fat cells, we examined the expression of CNTF receptor complex proteins (LIFR, gp130, and CNTFRalpha) during adipocyte differentiation and the effects of CNTF on STAT, Akt, and MAPK activation. We also examined the ability of CNTF to regulate the expression of adipocyte transcription factors and other adipogenic proteins. Our studies clearly demonstrate that the expression of two of the three CNTF receptor complex components, CNTFRalpha and LIFR, decreases during adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, gp130 expression is relatively unaffected by differentiation. In addition, preadipocytes are more sensitive to CNTF treatment than adipocytes, as judged by both STAT 3 and Akt activation. Despite decreased levels of CNTFRalpha expression in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, CNTF treatment of these cells resulted in a time-dependent activation of STAT 3. Chronic treatment of adipocytes resulted in a substantial decrease in fatty-acid synthase and a notable decline in SREBP-1 levels but had no effect on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, acrp30, adipocyte-expressed STAT proteins, or C/EBPalpha. However, CNTF resulted in a significant increase in IRS-1 expression. CNTFRalpha receptor expression was substantially induced in the fat pads of four rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes as compared with lean littermates. Moreover, we demonstrated that CNTF can activate STAT 3 in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in vivo. In summary, CNTF affects adipocyte gene expression, and the specific receptor for this cytokine is induced in rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Holbro and N.E. Hynes, unpublished data). As a consequence, these cells have decreased PI-3K/PKB signaling, a reduction in D-type cyclin levels, and show an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A main effector of ErbB signaling, the PI-3K/PKB pathway, is particularly important in mediating cell survival 103 T. Holbro et al. / Experimental Cell Research 284 (2003) 99-110 since several PKB substrates directly control various apoptotic processes. The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

We found that treatment of adult male mice by ISO (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) caused a delayed STAT3 activation (at 60-120 min), which was fully abolished by beta-AR antagonist, propranolol. ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly enhanced by phosphodiesterase inhibitor amrinone, indicating that cAMP is critically involved in beta-AR-mediated STAT3 activation. In addition, beta-AR stimulation significantly increased gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1). IL-6 protein levels in serum and mouse myocardium were also significantly increased in response to ISO treatment. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, IL-6 level was enhanced significantly after ISO (10-6 mol/liter) stimulation for 2 h and then peaked at 12 h, whereas the response of IL-6 in cultured cardiomyocytes to ISO stimulation was not significant, suggesting that ISO-induced increase in IL-6 is primarily from cardiac fibroblasts rather than cardiomyocytes. Most importantly, IL-6 could activate STAT3 in a time-dependent manner in cultured cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of IL-6 level by anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibody clearly attenuated ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in myocardium. Taken together, these results indicate that beta-AR stimulation leads to a delayed STAT3 activation via an IL-6 family of cytokine-mediated pathway and that cardiac fibroblasts, but not cardiomyocytes, is probably the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium.",

We and others have previously shown that these growth factors increase insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) number and mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells and that this effect is transcriptionally regulated. To study the mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved, IGF-1R promoter reporter constructs were transiently transfected in CHO-AT1 cells that overexpress angiotensin AT1 receptors. Our findings indicate that Ang II and bFGF significantly increased IGF-1R promoter activity up to 7- and 3-fold, respectively. The effect induced by Ang II was mediated via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism, since tyrphostin A25 largely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in promoter activity. In addition, co-transfection of dominant negative Ras, Raf, and MEK1 or pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 dose-dependently decreased both the Ang II- and bFGF-induced increase in IGF-1R transcription and protein expression, suggesting that the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathway is required for both growth factors. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to act as second messengers in Ang II-induced signaling, and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is redox-sensitive. While co-transfection of dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant completely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in transcription, it had no effect on the bFGF signaling. In contrast, co-transfection studies indicated that the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, and c-Jun and the Janus kinase 2 kinase are required in the signaling pathway of bFGF, whereas only dominant c-Jun inhibited the Ang II-induced effect. In summary, these data demonstrate that Ang II and bFGF increase IGF-1R gene transcription via distinct as well as shared pathways and have important implications for understanding growth-stimulatory effects of these growth factors on vascular cells.",

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

Ligand binding to ERBB receptors induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for a range of proteins, the recruitment of which leads to the activation of intracellular signalling pathways. None of the ligands bind ERBB2, but ERBB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for all the other ERBB receptors. ERBB3 has impaired kinase activity and only acquires signalling potential when it is dimerized with another ERBB receptor, such as ERBB2. Overexpression of ERBB2 in tumours leads to constitutive activation of ERBB2, presumably because of increased receptor concentrations at the plasma membrane. Many of these tumours contain phosphorylated ERBB3, which couples ERBB2 to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)?AKT pathway128.",

ERBB2 amplification and overexpression have been found in a number of human cancers, including breast, ovary and kidney carcinoma. Our aim was to detect ERBB2-regulated target genes that contribute to its tumorigenic effect on a genomewide scale. The differential gene expression profile of ERBB2-transfected and wild-type mouse fibroblasts was monitored employing DNA microarrays. Regulated expression of selected genes was verified by RT-PCR and validated by Western blot analysis. Genome wide gene expression profiling identified (i) known targets of ERBB2 signaling, (ii) genes implicated in tumorigenesis but so far not associated with ERBB2 signaling as well as (iii) genes not yet associated with oncogenic transformation, including novel genes without functional annotation. We also found that at least a fraction of coexpressed genes are closely linked on the genome. ERBB2 overexpression suppresses the transcription of antiangiogenic factors (e.g., Sparc, Timp3, Serpinf1) but induces expression of angiogenic factors (e.g., Klf5, Tnfaip2, Sema3c). Profiling of ERBB2-dependent gene regulation revealed a compendium of potential diagnostic markers and putative therapeutic targets. Identification of coexpressed genes that colocalize in the genome may indicate gene regulatory mechanisms that require further study to evaluate functional coregulation.

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

Similarly, 15(S)-HETE activated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-5B in a time-dependent manner. Dominant-negative mutant-mediated interference of STAT-5B activation suppressed 15(S)-HETE-induced HRMVEC migration and tube formation and Matrigel plug angiogenesis. The 15(S)-HETE induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in Jak2-STAT-5B-dependent manner in HRMVECs. In addition, neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibodies reduced 15(S)-HETE-induced HRMVEC migration and tube formation and Matrigel plug angiogenesis. Cloning and Transfac analysis of IL-8 promoter revealed the presence of 1 putative STAT-binding sequence at -476 nt, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed the binding of STAT-5B to this site in response to 15(S)-HETE. Mutational analysis showed that STAT binding site is essential for 15(S)-HETE-induced IL-8 promoter activity.

Our findings indicate that Ang II and bFGF significantly increased IGF-1R promoter activity up to 7- and 3-fold, respectively. The effect induced by Ang II was mediated via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism, since tyrphostin A25 largely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in promoter activity. In addition, co-transfection of dominant negative Ras, Raf, and MEK1 or pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 dose-dependently decreased both the Ang II- and bFGF-induced increase in IGF-1R transcription and protein expression, suggesting that the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathway is required for both growth factors. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to act as second messengers in Ang II-induced signaling, and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is redox-sensitive. While co-transfection of dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant completely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in transcription, it had no effect on the bFGF signaling. In contrast, co-transfection studies indicated that the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, and c-Jun and the Janus kinase 2 kinase are required in the signaling pathway of bFGF, whereas only dominant c-Jun inhibited the Ang II-induced effect. In summary, these data demonstrate that Ang II and bFGF increase IGF-1R gene transcription via distinct as well as shared pathways and have important implications for understanding growth-stimulatory effects of these growth factors on vascular cells.",

              "summary_text": "The growth-stimulating effects of thrombin are mediated primarily via activation of a G protein-coupled receptor, PAR-1. Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

Through the use of cell lines each lacking an individual JAK, we find that in contrast to interferon signaling, PDGF-induced JAK phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 and STAT3 is independent of the presence of any other single JAK but does require receptor tyrosine kinase activity.",

              "summary_text": "Endocrine therapy with an estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted antiestrogen, such as tamoxifen, or estrogen ablation by aromatase inhibitors is clinically indicated for the management of all forms of ER-positive breast cancer. However, 30-50% of ER-positive breast cancer cases fail to benefit clinically from endocrine therapy alone, and recent molecular evidence suggests that 'crosstalk' pathways originating from activated receptor tyrosine kinases and/or other proliferative and survival signals may be contributing to this endocrine resistance. Molecular identification and validation of candidate ER crosstalking pathways will likely lead to clinically important prognostic markers and targets for the application of novel therapeutics in combination with standard endocrine agents. This review focuses on a critical survival and proliferation pathway involving activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that for nearly two decades have been known to be critical regulators of mammalian immune and inflammatory responses, and more recently have been associated with chemotherapy resistance. With the demonstration that activation of NFkappaB is absolutely required for normal mammary gland development, NFkappaB involvment in human breast cancers was initially explored and linked to the development of hormone-independent (ER-negative) breast cancer. Newer clinical evidence now implicates NFkappaB activation, particularly DNA-binding by the p50 subunit of NFkappaB, as a potential prognostic marker capable of identifying a high-risk subset of ER-positive, primary breast cancers destined for early relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen. Furthermore, initial preclinical studies suggest that treatment strategies designed to prevent or interrupt activation of NFkappaB in cell-line models of these more aggressive, ER-positive breast cancers can restore their sensitivity to such standard endocrine agents as tamoxifen.",

Both the EGF-induced hyperphosphorylation and the transcriptional activation of the unliganded ER depend on a phosphorylatable serine residue at position 118. However, its phosphorylation is not sufficient and, hence, there must be other target domains or proteins which fulfill an additional requirement for EGF signaling through the ER. Using dominant-negative Ras and MAP kinase kinase (MAPK kinase) and constitutively active MAPK kinase mutants, we show that EGF activates the ER by signaling through the MAPK pathway suggesting that MAPK directly phosphorylates the critical serine 118.

All Raf kinases are composed of three conserved regions, CR1 (adjacent to the amino terminus), CR2, and CR3 (adjacent to the carboxyl terminus). The regulation of Raf kinase activity is a complex process involving phosphorylation of the regulatory and catalytic domains of the protein and both inter- and intramolecular interactions. The initial process of Raf activation involves the interaction of active GTP-bound Ras with the RBD of Raf and the adjacent zinc-binding cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of CR1, facilitating recruitment of Raf to the cell membrane for activation.78 The role of CR2, which is rich in serine and threonine residues, is less well defined; however, the phosphorylation of moieities within CR2 and various proteinprotein interactions involving CR2 also affect Raf localization and activation.89,119-121 Deletions of the amino-terminal regulatory domains CR1 and CR2, similar to v-Raf, are found in several types of human cancers with activating Raf mutations, suggesting that these domains negatively regulate Raf function. CR3, the catalytic domain of Raf, is also subject to regulation by phosphorylation. Regulation of Raf Kinase Activity General. The overlapping functional aspects of the three Raf isoforms have been elucidated by studies involving Raf knockout mice. In C-Raf knockouts, B-Raf can compensate for the loss of C-Raf in activating MEK in the MAPK pathway, but C-Raf knockouts are much more susceptible to apoptotic stimuli, despite the presence of A-Raf and B-Raf.122 With regard to differences in signaling between the Raf isoforms, A-Raf is a weaker activator of MEK than B-Raf or C-Raf. Furthermore, A-Raf can activate MEK1 only, whereas C-Raf activates both MEK1 and MEK2.123-125",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Serum stimulation or constitutive activation of ERK kinase (MEK1) results in phosphorylation and cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP-K.

Its catalytic domain is closely related to those of several other kinases, including mouse Mekk2, tobacco NPK, and yeast Ste11. Northern blot analysis revealed a   4.6-kb transcript that appears to be ubiquitously expressed. This protein directly regulates the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathways by activating SEK and MEK1/2 respectively; it does not regulate the p38 pathway. In cotransfection assays, it enhanced transcription from a nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB)-dependent reporter gene, consistent with a role in the SAPK pathway. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been observed.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are important modulators of cell growth under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We and others have previously shown that these growth factors increase insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) number and mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells and that this effect is transcriptionally regulated. To study the mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved, IGF-1R promoter reporter constructs were transiently transfected in CHO-AT1 cells that overexpress angiotensin AT1 receptors. Our findings indicate that Ang II and bFGF significantly increased IGF-1R promoter activity up to 7- and 3-fold, respectively. The effect induced by Ang II was mediated via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism, since tyrphostin A25 largely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in promoter activity. In addition, co-transfection of dominant negative Ras, Raf, and MEK1 or pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 dose-dependently decreased both the Ang II- and bFGF-induced increase in IGF-1R transcription and protein expression, suggesting that the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathway is required for both growth factors. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to act as second messengers in Ang II-induced signaling, and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is redox-sensitive. While co-transfection of dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant completely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in transcription, it had no effect on the bFGF signaling. In contrast, co-transfection studies indicated that the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, and c-Jun and the Janus kinase 2 kinase are required in the signaling pathway of bFGF, whereas only dominant c-Jun inhibited the Ang II-induced effect. In summary, these data demonstrate that Ang II and bFGF increase IGF-1R gene transcription via distinct as well as shared pathways and have important implications for understanding growth-stimulatory effects of these growth factors on vascular cells.",

Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454].

Although it is reported that IL-27 activates not only STAT-1, but also STAT-2, STAT-3, STAT-4 and STAT-5 in T cells [2,4,14,38], and activates STAT-3 in macrophages [39], it has not been clear whether the cytokine activates STAT-1 in macrophages. To determine whether IL-27 activates STAT-1 in CD4 T cells and MDM in our culture system, Western blot analysis was performed. The assay demonstrated that both cytokines induced the phosphorylation of STAT-1 in CD4 T cells and MDM (Fig. 2d).",

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Phenylalanine mutations at these three tyrosines results in a receptor that fails to constitutively activate the Erk pathway but retains the ability to induce Erk phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation. The ability of mRon to activate the MAP kinase pathway is dependent on c-Src activity, and we have shown that c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with mRon. c-Src fails to interact with mRon when the three tyrosines required for MAP kinase activation are mutated, whereas the presence of any one of these tyrosines alone restores Erk phosphorylation and recruitment of c-Src.",

Sustained mitochondrial dysfunction was also affected by ERK1/2, through a PKC-independent pathway. These findings suggest that activation of PKC-a and/or ERK1/2 lead to decreased activity of ATP synthase, rather than affecting OXPHOS system complexes [40]. Indeed, the a, b, and e subunits of F(1)F(0)- ATPase have PKC consensus motifs [41]. PKC-a phosphorylated the b subunit of F(1)F(0)-ATPase on a serine residue and decreased F(0)F(1)-ATPase activity, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production [41].",

              "summary_text": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a central pathway that transmits signals from many extracellular agents to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle progression. The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Understanding of these processes may provide a full picture of the distinct, and even opposing cellular processes that are regulated by the ERK cascade.",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Asthma is frequently associated with abnormal airway smooth muscle (ASM) growth that may contribute to airway narrowing and hyperresponsiveness to contractile agents. Although numerous hormones and cytokines have been shown to induce human ASM (HASM) proliferation, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HASM hyperplasia are largely unknown. Here we characterize the roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily [p42/p44 MAPK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), and p38] in mediating hormone- and cytokine-induced HASM proliferation. Significant enhancement of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in HASM cultures was observed only by treatment with agents (epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, thrombin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) that promoted a strong and sustained activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Significant activation of the JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways was only observed on stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, agents that did not appreciably stimulate HASM proliferation. Two different inhibitors of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), PD-98059 and U-0126, inhibited mitogen-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation in a manner consistent with their ability to inhibit p42/p44 activation. Elk-1 and activator protein-1 reporter activation by mitogens was similarly inhibited by inhibition of MEK, suggesting a linkage between p42/p44 activation, transcription factor activation, and HASM proliferation. These findings establish a fundamental role for p42/p44 activation in regulating HASM proliferation and provide insight into species-specific differences observed among studies in ASM mitogenesis.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

              "summary_text": "MyD88 also interacts directly with AKT, and a dominant-negative mutant of AKT causes a defect in MyD88-dependent NF-kB transcriptional activity. However, the binding of NF-kB to DNA is not affected by inhibiting AKT, indicating that AKT might be involved in the phosphorylation of the p65 transactivation domain. A dominant-negative mutant of MyD88 was shown to block the kinase activity of AKT generated in response to LPS and IL-1, and a dominant-negative mutant of p85 inhibited the NF-kB activity elicited by LPS and IL-1 but not that elicited by TNF85. These findings indicate that PI3K is a positive mediator of the signalling induced by LPS and IL-1 that leads to NF-kB activation. However, recent studies using mice that lack the p85 regulatory subunit showed an increased production of IL-12 by DCs, possibly because of enhanced activation of the p38 MAPK, indicating that PI3K might have a negative role in TLR signalling in DCs86.  ECSIT. ECSIT has no homology with any known protein and was cloned as a TRAF6-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening87. ECSIT interacts with the conserved TRAF domain of TRAF6. A Drosophila homologue of ECSIT has been identified, and the interaction between TRAF6 and ECSIT is also conserved in Drosophila. ECSIT also interacts with MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase kinase 1), which can phosphorylate and activate the IKK complex. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ECSIT blocks signalling through TLR4, indicating that ECSIT might transduce TLR signals by bridging TRAF6 and the IKK complex. Furthermore, the inhibition of ECSIT expression, using siRNA in a macrophage cell line, resulted in impaired LPS-induced, but not TNF-induced, NF-kB activation88. The physiological function of ECSIT was studied by generating ECSIT-deficient mice, which were found to die on about embryonic day 7.5 (Ref. 88). Further characterization showed that ECSIT is an obligatory intermediate in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, and therefore ECSIT is an essential component in both the TLR- and BMP-signalling pathways.  SRC family of tyrosine kinases. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the SRC-related TEC-family of protein tyrosine kinases and has an essential role in B-cell development and B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signalling. Macrophages from X-linked-immunodeficient mice that lack BTK show reduced responses to LPS, and BTK has also been found to associate with the TIR domain of TLR4,TLR6, TLR8 and TLR9 (Ref. 89). It has also been shown to associate with MyD88, TIRAP and IRAK1, and to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to LPS, whereas a dominant-negative form of BTK inhibits LPS-induced activation of NF-kB, indicating that BTK is involved in the TLR-mediated signalling pathway. During BCR-mediated signalling, BTK interacts with and is activated by the SRC family of tyrosine kinases, such as FYN, LYN and haematopoietic-cell kinase, HCK; however, SRC-family kinases have only a minor role in LPS signalling90. Therefore, the involvement of BTK in TLR signalling needs to be further investigated.  MAPKKK. Members of the MAPKKK family - such as TAK1, MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, TPL2 (tumour-progression locus 2; also known as cancer Osaka thyroid, COT) and NIK - are implicated in IKK-NF-kB and MAPK activation. Among these members, MEKK3 has been shown to be involved in signalling through TLR4 but not through TLR9 (Ref. 91): in response to stimulation with a TLR4 ligand but not a TLR9 ligand, embryonic fibroblasts from MEKK3-deficient mice were shown to have impaired IL-6 production and defective activation of NF-kB, JNK and the p38 MAPK. Stimulation of TLR4 also induced association of MEKK3 with TRAF6. So, MEKK3 is involved in the TLR4-mediated signalling pathway. Another member of the MKKK family, TPL2 has been shown to be involved in the TLR4-mediated activation of ERK92. In response to TLR4 ligand, TPL2-deficient...",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

The activities of these proteins are tightly controlled during cell adhesion to the ECM (Hynes, 2002Go; Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002Go). For example, Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion and, via specific effectors, stimulate the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex leading to actin polymerisation and lamellipodia and filopodia formation at the leading edge of cells",

Using recombinant Rho GTPases and LyGDI, we demonstrate that PLCbeta2 is stimulated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S])-activated Cdc42HsxLyGDI, but not by RhoAxLyGDI. Stimulation of PLCbeta2, which was also observed for GTP[S]-activated recombinant Rac1, was independent of LyGDI, but required C-terminal processing of Cdc42Hs/Rac1. Cdc42Hs/Rac1 also stimulated PLCbeta2 in a system made up of purified recombinant proteins, suggesting that this function is mediated by direct protein-protein interaction.",

Interestingly, Zhang et al. [40] also noted a decrease in the activation of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. This effect appeared not to arise through the hyperactivation of Ras, nor was it a consequence of CAPRI functioning as a Cdc42/Rac GEF, rather the authors show that CAPRI, via its Ras-GAP domain, can bind Rac and Cdc42 directly and act as a scaffold for presenting these GTPases to an unidentified GEF.

The results revealed that CXCL12-promoted migration of DN Rac or Vav1 SH3-SH2-SH3 transfectants was substantially lower than that displayed by transfectants expressing wt Rac, Vav1, or Cdc42, or DN Cdc42 (Figure 8Figure 8.). This migration was inhibited by anti-CXCR4 mAb (unpublished data), and by anti-?4 (Figure 8Figure 8.), indicating that was mediated by ?4?1. Together, these data indicate that activation of Rac and Vav1 by CXCL12 is a key signaling event that leads to efficient up-regulation of ?4?1-dependent T-cell adhesion and transendothelial migration.",

A recent report suggests that Rho/Rho kinase and MLCK may differentially regulate MLC phosphorylation according to spatial localization within cultured cells (144). Additional complexity in the system is provided by the contribution of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family, downstream effectors of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Isoforms PAK1 and PAK2 have both been shown to phosphorylate smooth muscle MLCK and decrease MLCK activity in cultured cells (61, 123), but whether PAK regulates the high-molecular-mass MLCK present in endothelium in this fashion is not clear. Conversely, PAK2 can directly phosphorylate MLC to produce EC contraction (163).",

Activation of the p38 MAPK cascade in Jurkat T cells has been shown to require phosphorylation of the GEF Vav by Zap-70 and subsequent activation of Rac-1. CD28 co-stimulation augments the recruitment of Vav to LAT and Zap-70 and increases Zap-70 mediated Vav phosphorylation [23].

Like vacuole formation, both of these latter processes are dependent on actin and microtubules (Greenberg, 1995; Davis and Camarillo, 1996; Cardelli, 2001). In addition, the inner surfaces of the pinocytosed membranes contain F-actin (Greenberg, 1995; Davis and Camarillo, 1996; Cardelli, 2001) (Fig. 11). Recent work has elucidated some of the molecular components involved in the cytoskeletal signaling pathways regulating macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. In both cases, Rho GTPases regulate these events. Rac and Cdc42 GTPases have been found to be required for macropinocytosis (Cardelli, 2001; Ridley, 2001a) and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis (Caron and Hall, 1998). Dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 markedly blocked EC vacuole and lumen formation in collagen and fibrin matrices, while dominant negative RhoA had no effect.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Hs766T cells express activated KRAS and display elevated levels of pERK1/2 and pAKT (Fig. 4C). Treatment of Hs766T cells with the PI3'-kinase inhibitor LY294002 led to a selective decrease in pAKT with little or no effect on pERK1/2. By contrast, treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or CI-1040 led to a selective decrease in pERK1/2 with little or no effect on pAKT. Strikingly, both the PI3'-kinase and the MEK inhibitors led to accumulation of p27Kip1 expression. These data are consistent with the observation that both MEK and PI3'-kinase inhibitors elicited a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in Hs766T cells (data not shown). Further consistent with these observations, treatment of a panel of pancreatic cancer cells (eight cell lines) (57) with a MEK inhibitor (U0126 or CI-1040) led to a consistent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest accompanied by induced expression of p27Kip1 in all eight cell lines tested (S. Gysin and M. McMahon, sub- mitted for publication). For the most part, treatment of cells with MEK inhibitors led to a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic effect, although cell death was often observed after prolonged treatment (+6 days). Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with LY294002 led in some cases to a cytostatic effect and in others to a more rapid cytotoxic effect. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 4C, inhibition of PI3'-kinase by LY294002 led to elevated p27Kip1 expression in five of eight pancreas cancer cell lines tested. These data are fully consistent with the hypothesis that the RAS-activated RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3'-kinase- PDK-AKT pathways play a role in the regulation of p27Kip1 expression in bona fide human cancer cell lines.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Another major signaling pathway is the Ras/MAP kinase cascade [33] (fig. 1). The activated Kit recruits SH-2-containing proteins such as Grb2, Shc and SHP2. Grb2 may bind Kit either directly or indirectly through interaction with Shc or SHP2. Since Grb2 is constitutively associated with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the recruitment of Grb2 to the activated Kit resultes in the colocalization of Sos and Ras and the subsequent activation of Ras. This promotes the interaction of Ras with Raf serinethreonine kinase and then the activation of MEK (a MAP kinase kinase). MEK phosphorylates ERK (a MAP kinase), and ERK phosphorylates a number of substrates, including pp90rsk [33]. Imatinib mesylate also inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK [34]. This process is considered to be due to blocking of the Kit signaling by this drug. Thus, both major signaling pathways of Kit, the PI3K/Akt system and the Ras/MAP kinase cascade, are inhibited by imatinib mesylate.",

The ds RNAi oligo for Daam1 reduces the protein level of Daam1, but not of RhoA, ?-catenin (Figure 3C) or Dvl2 (not shown). Importantly, the RNAi oligo inhibits RhoA activation by Wnt-1, Fz, or Dvl, but not by Ephexin (Figure 3C). A control ds RNAi oligo has no effect on Daam1 or RhoA protein level or RhoA activation (Figure 3C). Thus, Daam1 is essential for Wnt/Fz/Dvl activation of RhoA. AN ACTIVATED DAAM1 INDUCES RHO ACTIVATION IN A RHO-GEF-DEPENDENT MANNER Previous studies suggest that deletion of the amino terminal domain results in constitutive activation of FH proteins by releasing an intramolecular inhibition (Watanabe et al. 1999; Tominaga et al. 2000 and Westendorf 2001). C-Daam1 thus may represent an activated form of Daam1. Indeed, while the full length Daam1 is inactive, C-Daam1 overexpression causes activation of RhoA, but not of Rac or Cdc42 (Figure 3D). C-Daam1 activation of RhoA is not affected by ?PDZ-Dvl (Figure 3A), which inhibits RhoA activation by Fz or Dvl (Figure 1F), further demonstrating that Daam1 functions downstream of Dvl in Rho activation.",

In addition to its DH domain with GEF activity, LSC has a regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) domain, which binds to Galpha proteins and increases their intrinsic GTPase activity, thereby turning off GPCR signalling. So LSC seems to carry out two functions. First, it transduces GPCR signals from Galpha12 and Galpha13 proteins to activate RHOA and second, it attenuates other Galpha12- or Galpha13-coupled GPCR signals. In LSC-deficient mice, the number of B cells is decreased as are T cell-dependent antibody responses to protein antigens owing to a cell-intrinsic requirement for LSC in B cells27, 28. Further analysis has shown that LSC-deficient marginal zone B cells migrate more effectively in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in vitro, which might be due to the loss of LSC-mediated inhibition of signalling from Galpha12/13-coupled S1P receptors. By contrast, LSC-deficient marginal zone B cells have a defect in their ability to detach from ICAM1 and they do not migrate to the follicles following LPS stimulation in vivo. The defects in migration to the follicles might reflect a requirement for LSC-mediated RHOA activation in the disengagement of integrin binding at the trailing edge of the migrating B cell28. ",

              "summary_text": "Chloride channels, like Na+ channels, are more frequently activated by cytochalasin and inactivated by increasing actin cross linking, but again, there are exceptions to a simple interpretation, since F-actin itself can also activate some Cl channel activity.  In several cases where the effects of cytochalasin have been compared with those of nocodazole or colchicine, microtubule disruption has not been found to affect Na+, K+, or Cl channels. However, disruption of microtubules has been reported to enhance the activity of both Ca2+ (73, 218) and Cl (92, 109) channels in some cases.  An intriguing hypothesis for how disruption of actin may activate K+ channels is by release of protein kinase A (PKA) bound to the actin (175). In this model, the regulation depends not only on a link of actin to the receptor, but on changing localization of a cytoskeleton-bound signaling kinase, as discussed in section IIB.  Some Ca2+ channels are inactivated by cytochalasin, and the effect is blocked by phalloidin. However, stretch-activated Ca2+ influx can be activated by cytochalasin and inhibited by F-actin. Moreover, there are several reports of microtubule disruption also altering Ca2+ channel activity (73, 218), with a strong enhancement in one case that was not achieved by cytochalasin. A scenario derived from Reference 78 for how actin filaments may affect Ca2+ influx resulting from mechanical stresses is shown in Figure 2. In this model, application of a mechanical stress at the plasma membrane of a resting cell causes deformation of channels in the plasma membrane that results in Ca2+ influx. In these cells, a sustained mechanical stress leads to assembly of two distinct structures: contractile elements containing actin filaments that create an opposing force and an elastic network that resists subsequent application of the external stress. As the stress is transmitted to the newly formed three-dimensional cytoskeleton, it is directed away from the plasma membrane, and the deformation of membrane elements near the site of force is now insufficient to activate Ca2+ influx.   One context in which mechanical effects on the cytoskeleton regulate ion fluxes is volume regulation after osmotic stress. Although the elastic modulus of the cytoskeleton is probably too low (1,000-10,000 Pa in some cell types and lower in others) to prevent volume changes caused by osmotic imbalance (10,000 Pa/mosM), its presence as an elastic element provides the cell with a countering tension and a memory of the undeformed state, at least for the time that the cross-linked cytoskeleton remains intact. It is not surprising, therefore, that the cytoskeleton affects ion transport in volume regulation (33, 43, 92, 129, 193). Among the clearest evidence for a mechanical function comes from the finding that melanoma cells containing approximately normal amounts of cytoskeletal filaments and ion channels, but lacking the cross-linking protein ABP280 that provides rigidity to the cell cortex, fail to volume regulate under hypotonic conditions. Transfection of ABP280 to these cells restores this capacity (33).  Whether the effects of the cytoskeleton on ion channel activity are a direct mechanical effect or an indirect effect due to such changes as regulation of kinases sequestered at the cytoskeleton remains a controversial issue. There are reports that the cytoskeleton has no effect on channel activity and reports that ion conductance through channels within a lipid bilayer can be altered by bilayer dilation in the absence of any internal network (162). On the other hand, there are intriguing hypotheses that actin filaments and microtubules could directly transmit ion fluxes because of their polyelectrolyte nature and the presence of a condensed counterion cloud (133). Although such effects appear plausible from a physical-chemical perspective, demonstrating their importance in biological ion signaling remains a chal...",

We found that both constitutively active RhoA and dominant negative RhoA inhibited wound healing, suggesting that both activation and inhibition of RhoA interfere with normal wound healing. Overexpression of wild-type Rac1 induced upregulation of RhoA, disrupted intercellular junctions, and inhibited wound closure. Dominant negative Rac1 also inhibited wound closure. Inhibition of the downstream effector of RhoA, Rho-kinase, with Y-27632 suppressed actin stress fibers and focal adhesion formation, increased Rac1 activity, and stimulated wound closure.RhoA and Rac1 are both required for efficient wound closure of airway epithelial cells",

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

We observed that coexpression of oncogenic p21ras stimulated the transactivating activity of NF-IL6 and induced phosphorylation of Thr-235 located just N-terminal to the DNA binding domain of NF-IL6. Recently, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been shown to be implicated in the cellular response to activated ras. Purified MAP kinases specifically phosphorylated Thr-235 of NF-IL6 in vitro. Mutation of Thr-235 abolished the ras-dependent activation of NF-IL6. From these results, we conclude that NF-IL6 is regulated through phosphorylation by MAP kinases in response to activated ras.",

              "summary_text": "Also, antioxidants decrease the mRNA abundance of MSR-1 by suppressing NF-kB and decreasing MSR-1 mRNA stability rather than through direct effects on transcription [102]. A summary of redox effects on various transcription factors as well as on some elements of signal transduction pathways is presented in Table 1. Although Table 1 presents an overview of the effects as well as the differences that may occur between different cell models, a comprehensive presentation of all redox effects on these factors and their interactions is far beyond the scope of the present discussion. For more detailed discussions of some of the effects listed in Table 1, the reader is referred to several excellent reviews [14-17,93,103-105]. Also, we have primarily focused on oxygen-centered species rather than on reactive nitrogen species; for a review of nitrogen intermediates in signal transduction, the reader is referred to the article by Lander [90]. SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS Although many pathways are known to be redoxsensitive, none have been more thoroughly examined than the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways. Many of the redox effects on cells are mediated either directly or indirectly through these pathways, which contain multiple steps sensitive to ROS. Because of the large number of studies of oxidants on the various components of the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways, we provide a brief overview of both these pathways. MAP kinases Extracellular signaling molecules such as growth factors and cytokines induce changes in cell behavior via complex mechanisms that involve transmission of the signal from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, where gene expression is altered [303,304]. The first step of a signaling cascade usually involves the activation of receptors that either have protein kinase activity or activate protein kinases in the cytoplasm. The signal is eventually transmitted to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription factors that regulate gene expression. One of the most studied families of signal transduction pathways is the (MAP) kinase family (Fig. 1). Four MAP kinase subfamilies have been identified to date: (i) ERK [305- 309], (ii) JNK/SAP kinase [310-314], (iii) p38 kinases, [315-318], and (iv) big MAP kinase (BMK/ERK5) [319, 320]. All these pathways contain redox-sensitive sites (Table 1). In the ERK and JNK pathways, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor such as the mammalian homologue of Sos [321] activates Ras by conversion of Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP [322-324]. Sos must usually complex with other proteins to perform this function. It contains SH2 domains, which are a conserved sequence of 100 amino acids that bind to tyrosine phosphorylated motifs in other proteins [17]. In the cytoplasm, Sos is constitutively bound to another SH2 domain-containing protein, Grb-2 [325-327]. Activation of growth factor receptors results in tyrosine autophosphorylation and recruitment of SH2 domain-containing affectors, including Grb-2 [325,328-330]. The result is plasma membrane targeting of Sos [331], where it is tyrosinephosphorylated [332] (Fig. 1). The phosphorylated Grb-2/Sos complex binds to an adapter protein, the SH-containing (SHC) protein [330, 333-336], and the multiprotein complex activates Ras-GDP by converting it to its GTP-bound form [337]. Interestingly, treatment of cells with oxidants such as H2O2 stimulates formation of the SHC-Grb2-Sos complex [99].",

We and others have previously demonstrated that Ras activates the inherent transcriptional activation function of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Supportive of the importance of NF-kappaB in transformation, Ras-induced cellular transformation can be suppressed by expression of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or by dominant-negative forms of the upstream activator IkappaB kinase (IKK). However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.",

              "summary_text": "We chose to analyze pancreatic cancer cells since this tumor type displays the highest frequency of somatic mutations of RAS genes of all human malignancies (5, 22). Hs766T cells express activated KRAS and display elevated levels of pERK1/2 and pAKT (Fig. 4C). Treatment of Hs766T cells with the PI3'-kinase inhibitor LY294002 led to a selective decrease in pAKT with little or no effect on pERK1/2. By contrast, treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or CI-1040 led to a selective decrease in pERK1/2 with little or no effect on pAKT. Strikingly, both the PI3'-kinase and the MEK inhibitors led to accumulation of p27Kip1 expression. These data are consistent with the observation that both MEK and PI3'-kinase inhibitors elicited a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in Hs766T cells (data not shown). Further consistent with these observations, treatment of a panel of pancreatic cancer cells (eight cell lines) (57) with a MEK inhibitor (U0126 or CI-1040) led to a consistent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest accompanied by induced expression of p27Kip1 in all eight cell lines tested (S. Gysin and M. McMahon, sub- mitted for publication). For the most part, treatment of cells with MEK inhibitors led to a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic effect, although cell death was often observed after prolonged treatment (+6 days). Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with LY294002 led in some cases to a cytostatic effect and in others to a more rapid cytotoxic effect. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 4C, inhibition of PI3'-kinase by LY294002 led to elevated p27Kip1 expression in five of eight pancreas cancer cell lines tested. These data are fully consistent with the hypothesis that the RAS-activated RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3'-kinase- PDK-AKT pathways play a role in the regulation of p27Kip1 expression in bona fide human cancer cell lines.",

Grb2 may bind Kit either directly or indirectly through interaction with Shc or SHP2. Since Grb2 is constitutively associated with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the recruitment of Grb2 to the activated Kit resultes in the colocalization of Sos and Ras and the subsequent activation of Ras. This promotes the interaction of Ras with Raf serinethreonine kinase and then the activation of MEK (a MAP kinase kinase). MEK phosphorylates ERK (a MAP kinase), and ERK phosphorylates a number of substrates, including pp90rsk [33]. Imatinib mesylate also inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK [34]. This process is considered to be due to blocking of the Kit signaling by this drug. Thus, both major signaling pathways of Kit, the PI3K/Akt system and the Ras/MAP kinase cascade, are inhibited by imatinib mesylate.",

Here, we discuss interconnecting signaling pathways controlled by RB and p53, attempting to explain their potentially universal involvement in the etiology of cancer. Pinpointing the various ways by which the functions of RB and p53 are subverted in individual tumors should provide a rational basis for developing more refined tumor-specific therapies.",

              "summary_text": "Raf may also be activated by Ras-independent elements and, in turn, propagates signals through diverse effectors that mediate proliferation, angiogenesis, metastases, and survival.5 Raf may be activated by signaling upstream or constitutively. Constitutive activation of Raf and Ras are indistinguishable in their potential to induce malignant transformation.6-8 Activating raf mutations have been identified in melanoma, thyroid, colon, and other cancers (Table 1).9-43 Furthermore, the disappointing clinical results of farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitors (FTIs) that were developed based on a flawed premise that they would effectively target malignancies with a high incidence of Ras mutation has led to scrutiny of signaling elements downstream of Ras, such as Raf, as therapeutic targets.44 This review highlights relevant information about the biology of Raf and novel strategies directed at exploiting this knowledge to more effectively treat malignant diseases. SIGNALING THROUGH THE MAPK PATHWAY The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival are receiving considerable attention as potential targets for anticancer strategies. 45,46 Recently, there has been a notable increase in efforts directed at targeting the MAPK pathway, which integrates a wide array of proliferative signals initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein- coupled receptors.47,48 The network of signals emanating from the MAPK pathway are transmitted by proteins that serve as chemical switches, cycling between phosphorylated (activated) and dephosphorylated (inactivated) states.49 These on and off switches are regulated by kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Activated signaling elements, in turn, phosphorylate amino acid residues on downstream signaling proteins in a cascade-like and expansive manner.50 Not only does the centrality of the MAPK pathway render its components important targets for therapeutic development, but many genes that encode for its critical signaling elements undergo mutations, constitutively activating downstream signaling elements and conferring the potential for transformation and autonomous growth.50-52 In addition to efforts directed at Ras, therapeutic strategies directed at the MAPK pathway are targeting the cascade of downstream effector proteins including Raf, MAPK kinase (MAPKK; also called MEK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK] kinase), and ERK. The Raf/MEK/ERK module (Fig 1) of the MAPK pathway, which is immediately downstream of Ras, may be less redundant and innately resistant to therapeutic manipulations compared with Ras (as discussed in the next section). The Unfilled Promise of Targeting Ras The Raf/MEK/ERK module of the MAPK pathway has been the focus of considerable attention because therapeutic efforts directed at Ras, which is situated at the apex of the MAPK pathway, have been disappointing.44 Ras belongs to a superfamily of guanine nucleotide triphosphatases (GTPases) that transmit proliferative and survival signals to the MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and other pathways (Figs 1 and 2). Three ras proto-oncogenes encode four 21-kd proteins, called p21ras or Ras (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B, resulting from two alternatively spliced K-Ras gene products), that are localized to the inner surface of the cell membrane.44 Of the three ras genes, K-ras mutations are most commonly found in solid malignancies, whereas N-ras mutations are encountered less often, and H-ras mutations are rarely encountered.53,54 Ras isoforms impart distinct biologic effects as a result of the potential of these proteins to differentially activitate critical effectors.55 After synthesis as inactive cytosolic propeptides, Ras undergoes a series of post-translational modifications at its carboxyl terminus that increase its hydrophobicity.56,57 These modifications render Ras functional and capable of lo...",

              "summary_text": "It is in the cell membrane where Ras cycles between inactive guanosine diphosphate-bound and active guanosine triphosphate (GTP) -bound states, thereby activating a series of effector kinases that phosphorylate a cascade of signaling proteins.58 Ras mutants exhibit slightly less intrinsic GTPase activity than wild-type Ras; however, the principal consequence of the mutated proteins is a marked decrease in interactions between Ras and its GTPase activator protein.59 Instead of reverting to its inactive guanosine diphosphate-bound state, the modified conformation of mutant Ras favors its active GTP-bound state, which has a higher propensity to activate downstream effectors even in the absence of growth factor stimulation, conferring a proliferative advantage to tumors. The considerable attention paid to targeting Ras as a therapeutic strategy is based on the high incidence of activating ras mutations in human malignancies, including approximately 22% of non-small-cell lung, 50% of colorectal, and 90% of pancreatic cancers.53,60,61 Of the strategies directed at Ras, targeting FTase has received the most attention, but the FTIs are not Ras specific, and a bonafide Ras-specific therapeutic agent has not yet been evaluated in clinical trials.62,63 Fortunately, because K-ras mutations constitute most ras mutations in the aforementioned malignancies, in which the therapeutic expectations of FTIs were among the highest, the failure of this strategy should not be surprising because geranylgeranyl transferase I can alternatively prenylate K-ras, rendering it functional even when FTase is completely inhibited. 64,65 Although the FTIs have shown notable antitumor activity in patients with advanced breast cancer and some hematologic malignancies, the low ras mutation rates in these cancers suggest that farnesylation of other critical proteins is being inhibited.66 DOWNSTREAM OF RAS: RAF AND OTHER RAS EFFECTORS Localization of GTP-bound Ras to the inner surface of the cell membrane activates several downstream effectors, most notably the serine/threonine kinase Raf, which is the first signaling element in the MAPK pathway.2,67,68 As shown in Figure 1, other downstream effectors of Ras include the PI3K cell survival pathway, the small GTP-binding proteins Rac and Rho, and the stress-activated protein kinase pathway (also referred to as the c-jun N-terminal kinase [JNK] pathway).69-71 In addition, in response to cellular stress and cytokine stimulation mediated through Ras, the dual-specificity p38MAPK kinases (MKK3 and MKK6) and the JNK kinases (MKK4 and MKK7) phosphorylate p38MAPK and JNK, respectively.72-76 GTP-bound Ras interacts directly with Raf and mobilizes the inactive protein from the cytoplasm (Figs 1 and 2). Once the Ras-Raf complex is translocated to the cell membrane, Ras activates the serine/threonine kinase function of Raf through an association between its Ras-binding domain (RBD) in the amino-terminal regulatory region and Ras-GTP. This is followed by a series of Ras-dependent phosphorylation events and conformational changes, which will be described later in this review.77-84 The regulatory mechanisms of various Raf isoforms differ in that A-Raf and C-Raf require additional phosphorylation reactions for activity, whereas B-Raf has a much higher level of basal kinase activity.85 Raf is also activated by Ras-independent activators, including the soluble non-RTK Src and Janus kinase 1,",

Constitutive activation of STAT5 has also been associated with leukemic transformation. We overexpressed the constitutively active mutant STAT5A(1*6) in human cord blood CD34+ cells and evaluated the effects on the hematopoietic potential of stem cells in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems. The observed phenotypic changes were correlated with differential gene expression patterns induced by STAT5A(1*6). Our data indicate that a persistent activation of STAT5A in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells results in their enhanced self-renewal and diverts differentiation to the erythroid lineage.",

              "summary_text": "Chloride channels, like Na+ channels, are more frequently activated by cytochalasin and inactivated by increasing actin cross linking, but again, there are exceptions to a simple interpretation, since F-actin itself can also activate some Cl channel activity.  In several cases where the effects of cytochalasin have been compared with those of nocodazole or colchicine, microtubule disruption has not been found to affect Na+, K+, or Cl channels. However, disruption of microtubules has been reported to enhance the activity of both Ca2+ (73, 218) and Cl (92, 109) channels in some cases.  An intriguing hypothesis for how disruption of actin may activate K+ channels is by release of protein kinase A (PKA) bound to the actin (175). In this model, the regulation depends not only on a link of actin to the receptor, but on changing localization of a cytoskeleton-bound signaling kinase, as discussed in section IIB.  Some Ca2+ channels are inactivated by cytochalasin, and the effect is blocked by phalloidin. However, stretch-activated Ca2+ influx can be activated by cytochalasin and inhibited by F-actin. Moreover, there are several reports of microtubule disruption also altering Ca2+ channel activity (73, 218), with a strong enhancement in one case that was not achieved by cytochalasin. A scenario derived from Reference 78 for how actin filaments may affect Ca2+ influx resulting from mechanical stresses is shown in Figure 2. In this model, application of a mechanical stress at the plasma membrane of a resting cell causes deformation of channels in the plasma membrane that results in Ca2+ influx. In these cells, a sustained mechanical stress leads to assembly of two distinct structures: contractile elements containing actin filaments that create an opposing force and an elastic network that resists subsequent application of the external stress. As the stress is transmitted to the newly formed three-dimensional cytoskeleton, it is directed away from the plasma membrane, and the deformation of membrane elements near the site of force is now insufficient to activate Ca2+ influx.   One context in which mechanical effects on the cytoskeleton regulate ion fluxes is volume regulation after osmotic stress. Although the elastic modulus of the cytoskeleton is probably too low (1,000-10,000 Pa in some cell types and lower in others) to prevent volume changes caused by osmotic imbalance (10,000 Pa/mosM), its presence as an elastic element provides the cell with a countering tension and a memory of the undeformed state, at least for the time that the cross-linked cytoskeleton remains intact. It is not surprising, therefore, that the cytoskeleton affects ion transport in volume regulation (33, 43, 92, 129, 193). Among the clearest evidence for a mechanical function comes from the finding that melanoma cells containing approximately normal amounts of cytoskeletal filaments and ion channels, but lacking the cross-linking protein ABP280 that provides rigidity to the cell cortex, fail to volume regulate under hypotonic conditions. Transfection of ABP280 to these cells restores this capacity (33).  Whether the effects of the cytoskeleton on ion channel activity are a direct mechanical effect or an indirect effect due to such changes as regulation of kinases sequestered at the cytoskeleton remains a controversial issue. There are reports that the cytoskeleton has no effect on channel activity and reports that ion conductance through channels within a lipid bilayer can be altered by bilayer dilation in the absence of any internal network (162). On the other hand, there are intriguing hypotheses that actin filaments and microtubules could directly transmit ion fluxes because of their polyelectrolyte nature and the presence of a condensed counterion cloud (133). Although such effects appear plausible from a physical-chemical perspective, demonstrating their importance in biological ion signaling remains a chal...",
