If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

Although vascular SMC are known to express the ET(B)-R, its transcriptional regulation has not been studied thus far. Here we demonstrate that the potent inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB activation, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC; 30-100 microM), induces de novo ET(B)-R expression in rat aortic and mesenteric cultured SMC. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses revealed that besides inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB, PDTC enhances activator protein-1 (AP-1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and GATA-2 activity in these cells. Preincubation of PDTC-stimulated cells with appropriate decoy oligodeoxynucleotides confirmed the involvement of these three transcription factors, namely that of AP-1, in ET(B)-R expression. The stimulatory effect of PDTC on ET(B)-R expression was also confirmed functionally by monitoring an enhanced ET-1-induced apoptosis in PDTC-treated cells that was sensitive to the ET(B)-R antagonist, BQ788. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that C/EBP, GATA-2, and in particular AP-1 can control ET(B)-R expression in vascular SMC. They further support the notion that ET(B)-R expression in these cells may play an important role in cardiovascular complications, such as restenosis following angioplasty that in the early phase is characterized by prominent SMC apoptosis.",

The induction of the Gadd genes suggested that JNK2AS-treated cells were under stress and prompted us to examine the expression of two other stress-regulated genes: (a) Grp78, a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding; and (b) the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1, which we had found previously to be up-regulated in other JNK2AS-treated cells (17 , 18) . Both genes were markedly up-regulated in JNK2AS-treated cells (Fig. 4C)Citation , suggesting that depletion of JNK2 in PC3 cells facilitates the induction of several independent stress-signaling pathways. Activation of the JNK pathway is important for the phosphorylation and activation of protein components of AP-1 transcription factor complexes (1, 2, 3, 4 , 5, 6, 7 , 28) , suggesting that genes regulated by AP-1-dependent transcription could be negatively affected by JNKAS treatment. Indeed, we detected reduced expression of several AP-1-regulated genes, including lamin A-C (29) , and integrin b-4 (Ref. 30 ; Fig. 4DCitation ). Among other genes whose lower expression after JNK2AS treatment was verified by Northern blotting were HMG-I(Y), a protein highly expressed in prostate cancer (31) and recently identified as a myc-regulated oncogene (32) , Lsm5 (33) , transcobalamin, and DSS1 (Ref. 34 ; Fig. 4Citation D, and data not shown). Importantly, although most JNK2AS-altered genes appeared to be specific for treatment with this oligonucleotide, some gene expression changes were also seen in the JNK1AS- and JNKScr-treated groups, indicating that a more global response to the uptake of oligonucleotides (Fig. 4E)Citation was elicited. Within this group were two IFN-inducible genes, ISGF-3 and ISG15, suggesting that application of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides could induce IFN-dependent responses.",

Recent studies suggest that decreased aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is correlated with increased staining of MUC5AC in submucosal glands of COPD patients. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the major insults in airway mucin secretion in COPD. In this study, changes in both AQP5 and MUC5AC expression levels in SPC-A1, a human airway submucosal gland cell line, were quantified after exposure of the cells to LPS. AQP5 transcription and protein expression were decreased while MUC5AC expression was increased by LPS exposure in SPC-A1 cells. Further studies revealed that AQP5 expression was down-regulated via the p38/JNK signaling pathway, while MUC5AC was up-regulated through the EGFR-p38/JNK pathway. Therefore, p38 and JNK may become promising targets to preserve AQP5 expression and prevent MUC5AC over-expression to restore proper H(2)O to mucin ratio of the airway mucus, which may be beneficial to the clinical management of COPD patients.",

Although nonsurgical treatment for AAA is much awaited, few options are available because its molecular pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we identify JNK as a proximal signaling molecule in the pathogenesis of AAA. Human AAA tissue showed a high level of phosphorylated JNK. We show that JNK programs a gene expression pattern in different cell types that cooperatively enhances the degradation of the extracellular matrix while suppressing biosynthetic enzymes of the extracellular matrix. Selective inhibition of JNK in vivo not only prevented the development of AAA but also caused regression of established AAA in two mouse models. Thus, JNK promotes abnormal extracellular matrix metabolism in the tissue of AAA and may represent a therapeutic target.",

We identified 147 genes whose levels of expression were significantly altered in RNA obtained from cells demonstrating a transformed phenotype with stable GLI1 expression or stable Ha-ras expression. Comparison of expression profiles from GLI1- and Ha-ras-expressing cells established a set of genes unique to GLI1-induced cell transformation. Thirty genes were altered by stable GLI1 expression, and 124 genes were changed by stable Ha-ras expression. Seven genes had altered expression levels in both GLI1- and Ha-ras-expressing cells. Genes whose expression was altered by GLI1 included cell cycle genes, cell adhesion genes, signal transduction genes, and genes regulating apoptosis. GLI1 consensus DNA-binding sequences were identified in the 5' regions of cyclin D2, IGFBP-6, osteopontin, and plakoglobin, suggesting that these genes represent immediate downstream targets. Gel shift analysis confirmed the ability of the GLI1 protein to bind these sequences. Up-regulation of cyclin D2 and down-regulation of plakoglobin were demonstrated in GLI1-amplified compared with non-amplified human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Many of the GLI1 targets with known function identified in this study increase cell proliferation, indicating that GLI1-induced cell transformation occurs through multiple downstream pathways.",

              "summary_text": "Therefore, the apoptotic effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy on proliferating vascular endothelium could contribute to the anti-tumor efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo. While it is relatively simple, however, to study chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells or tumor cells separately in vitro, it is not trivial to analyze apoptosis in these two populations when they are crowded together in a tumor. Browder et al. approached this problem by carrying out animal experiments in which the apoptotic effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on endothelial cells in a tumor bed was dissociated from the apoptotic effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on tumor cells supported by these endothelial cells [35]. Browder et al. hypothesized, that the tradition of administering chemotherapy at maximum tolerated dose (MTD), required a treatment-free interval to allow recovery of the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. During the treatment-free interval, microvascular endothelial cells in the tumor bed could resume their proliferation and support tumor regrowth. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with cyclophosphamide at a conventional maximum tolerated dose followed by a 21-day interval to rescue bone marrow, ('conventional schedule'), tumors recurred after each cycle. All animals eventually died of large tumors which had a diminished response to cyclophosphamide after each cycle, i.e. the tumors developed acquired drug resistance. In contrast, if cyclophosphamide was administered more frequently and at lower doses ('antiangiogenic schedule'), without a prolonged treatment-free interval, all tumors regressed and all animals survived without bone marrow suppression or other toxicity. Then the tumors were made drug-resistant to cyclophosphamide. On the 'conventional schedule', animals died even more rapidly with large tumors as drug resistant tumor cells continued to proliferate unaffected by cyclophosphamide. However, the 'antiangiogenic schedule' significantly inhibited tumor growth, but there was still very slow tumor growth. It was not possible to raise the low dose of cyclophosphamide to a level sufficient to induce apoptosis of the remaining endothelial cells in the tumor bed, without provoking bone marrow suppression. Therefore, a low dose of a pure angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470 was added. This inhibitor by itself could not slow this tumor by more than 65%. However, when combined with cyclophosphamide on the antiangiogenic schedule, there was complete tumor regression and long-term survival in all but one animal. Immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 3) revealed extensive endothelial apoptosis that preceded tumor cell apoptosis by 4-5 days, despite the fact that the tumor cells were resistant to cyclophosphamide and not directly affected by TNP-470. This experiment reveals an endothelial-dependence of cytotoxic chemotherapy that is concealed before tumor cells have acquired drug resistance. Klement et al. obtained similar results by administering continuous low dose vinblastine to tumor-bearing mice in combination with a VEGF receptor antibody [36]. Furthermore, these results might also help to explain why some patients who receive long-term maintenance or even palliative chemotherapy have stable disease beyond the time that the tumor would have been expected to develop drug resistance. Patients with slow-growing cancers who are on 'antiangiogenic scheduling' of chemotherapy involving continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil [37-39], weekly paclitaxel [40,41], or daily oral etoposide [42-44], have shown an improved outcome--despite the fact that in some of these patients the tumors had already become drug resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic chemotherapy has also been called 'metronomic' therapy [45], but the two terms do not have precisely the same meaning. 'Antiangiogenic chemotherapy' signifies that the target of the chemotherapy is microvascular endothelium in the tumor b...",

Here we analyse tumours initiated by an endogenous oncogene, ras, and show that senescent cells exist in premalignant tumours but not in malignant ones. Senescence is therefore a defining feature of premalignant tumours that could prove valuable in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.  We used a mouse model for cancer initiation in humans: the animals have a conditional oncogenic K-rasV12 allele that is activated only by the enzyme Cre recombinase3, causing them to develop multiple lung adenomas (premalignant tumours) and a few lung adenocarcinomas (malignant tumours). Senescence markers previously identified in cultured cells were used to detect oncogene-induced senescence in lung sections from control mice (expressing Cre) and from K-rasV12-expressing mice (expressing Cre and activated K-rasV12). We analysed p16INK4a, an effector of in vitro oncogene-induced senescence1, and de novo markers that we identified by using DNA microarray analysis of in vitro oncogene-induced senescence (see supplementary information). These de novo markers are p15INK4b (also known as CDKN2B), Dec1 (BHLHB2) and DcR2 (TNFRSF10D). In addition, we looked for two features evident in cultured senescent cells, namely the expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase4 and the presence of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci5.  Staining with antibodies against p16INK4a, p15INK4b, Dec1 and DcR2 revealed abundant positive cells in adenomas, whereas adenocarcinomas were essentially negative (Fig. 1a).",

Other adaptor molecules that bind to PDGF receptors are Shc, Grb7, Nck, and Crk.  After binding of Shc to the PDGF receptors, it becomes phosphorylated on Tyr-317, which can be recognized by Grb2/Sos and thus contributes to Ras activation (398), as well as on Tyr-239 and Tyr-240, which initiates another signaling pathway leading to induction of c-myc (148).",

These efforts have resulted in new insights into Rasmediated cell signaling as it relates to human cancer. Ras plays a central role in an intricate array of signal transduction pathways, characterized by cross talk, feedback loops, and multicomponent signaling complexes.1-3 One strategy to overcome the challenges inherent in developing therapeutics against signaling elements situated in redundant pathways is to target elements downstream of convergence points of critical signaling modules. This reasoning has led, in part, to interest in Raf kinase, which is one of several downstream effectors of Ras, as a target for therapeutic development against cancer. The Raf serine/threonine kinases are the principal effectors of Ras in the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Fig 1).

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Human tumours that bypass premalignant stages have not been described. The importance of the angiogenic switch was also recently demonstrated by Weinberg and colleagues55. They showed that expression of the SV40 early region, TERT and activated RAS were sufficient to transform primary epithelial cells in vitro. However, the ability to grow in vivo depended on the level of HRAS expression - cells that expressed low levels of RAS were dormant and non-angiogenic, whereas cells that expressed high levels of RAS developed into full-blown tumours.",

              "summary_text": "Also, antioxidants decrease the mRNA abundance of MSR-1 by suppressing NF-kB and decreasing MSR-1 mRNA stability rather than through direct effects on transcription [102]. A summary of redox effects on various transcription factors as well as on some elements of signal transduction pathways is presented in Table 1. Although Table 1 presents an overview of the effects as well as the differences that may occur between different cell models, a comprehensive presentation of all redox effects on these factors and their interactions is far beyond the scope of the present discussion. For more detailed discussions of some of the effects listed in Table 1, the reader is referred to several excellent reviews [14-17,93,103-105]. Also, we have primarily focused on oxygen-centered species rather than on reactive nitrogen species; for a review of nitrogen intermediates in signal transduction, the reader is referred to the article by Lander [90]. SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS Although many pathways are known to be redoxsensitive, none have been more thoroughly examined than the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways. Many of the redox effects on cells are mediated either directly or indirectly through these pathways, which contain multiple steps sensitive to ROS. Because of the large number of studies of oxidants on the various components of the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways, we provide a brief overview of both these pathways. MAP kinases Extracellular signaling molecules such as growth factors and cytokines induce changes in cell behavior via complex mechanisms that involve transmission of the signal from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, where gene expression is altered [303,304]. The first step of a signaling cascade usually involves the activation of receptors that either have protein kinase activity or activate protein kinases in the cytoplasm. The signal is eventually transmitted to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription factors that regulate gene expression. One of the most studied families of signal transduction pathways is the (MAP) kinase family (Fig. 1). Four MAP kinase subfamilies have been identified to date: (i) ERK [305- 309], (ii) JNK/SAP kinase [310-314], (iii) p38 kinases, [315-318], and (iv) big MAP kinase (BMK/ERK5) [319, 320]. All these pathways contain redox-sensitive sites (Table 1). In the ERK and JNK pathways, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor such as the mammalian homologue of Sos [321] activates Ras by conversion of Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP [322-324]. Sos must usually complex with other proteins to perform this function. It contains SH2 domains, which are a conserved sequence of 100 amino acids that bind to tyrosine phosphorylated motifs in other proteins [17]. In the cytoplasm, Sos is constitutively bound to another SH2 domain-containing protein, Grb-2 [325-327]. Activation of growth factor receptors results in tyrosine autophosphorylation and recruitment of SH2 domain-containing affectors, including Grb-2 [325,328-330]. The result is plasma membrane targeting of Sos [331], where it is tyrosinephosphorylated [332] (Fig. 1). The phosphorylated Grb-2/Sos complex binds to an adapter protein, the SH-containing (SHC) protein [330, 333-336], and the multiprotein complex activates Ras-GDP by converting it to its GTP-bound form [337]. Interestingly, treatment of cells with oxidants such as H2O2 stimulates formation of the SHC-Grb2-Sos complex [99].",

FGF and IL- 6 activate ERK1/ 2, PI- 3 kinase and STAT3, respectively. The serine phosphorylation of STAT3 via the FGF- induced ERK1/ 2 activation contributes to the full activation of STAT3, leadingto the expression of c-myc and bcl- 2 genes and cell proliferation 91 .FRS:FGF receptor substrate.",

              "summary_text": "Extensive data indicate that oncoproteins, such as oncogenic H-Ras, initiate signal transduction cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of specific transcription factors. We and others have previously demonstrated that Ras activates the inherent transcriptional activation function of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Supportive of the importance of NF-kappaB in transformation, Ras-induced cellular transformation can be suppressed by expression of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or by dominant-negative forms of the upstream activator IkappaB kinase (IKK). However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.",

              "summary_text": "We chose to analyze pancreatic cancer cells since this tumor type displays the highest frequency of somatic mutations of RAS genes of all human malignancies (5, 22). Hs766T cells express activated KRAS and display elevated levels of pERK1/2 and pAKT (Fig. 4C). Treatment of Hs766T cells with the PI3'-kinase inhibitor LY294002 led to a selective decrease in pAKT with little or no effect on pERK1/2. By contrast, treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or CI-1040 led to a selective decrease in pERK1/2 with little or no effect on pAKT. Strikingly, both the PI3'-kinase and the MEK inhibitors led to accumulation of p27Kip1 expression. These data are consistent with the observation that both MEK and PI3'-kinase inhibitors elicited a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in Hs766T cells (data not shown). Further consistent with these observations, treatment of a panel of pancreatic cancer cells (eight cell lines) (57) with a MEK inhibitor (U0126 or CI-1040) led to a consistent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest accompanied by induced expression of p27Kip1 in all eight cell lines tested (S. Gysin and M. McMahon, sub- mitted for publication). For the most part, treatment of cells with MEK inhibitors led to a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic effect, although cell death was often observed after prolonged treatment (+6 days). Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with LY294002 led in some cases to a cytostatic effect and in others to a more rapid cytotoxic effect. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 4C, inhibition of PI3'-kinase by LY294002 led to elevated p27Kip1 expression in five of eight pancreas cancer cell lines tested. These data are fully consistent with the hypothesis that the RAS-activated RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3'-kinase- PDK-AKT pathways play a role in the regulation of p27Kip1 expression in bona fide human cancer cell lines.",

Grb2 may bind Kit either directly or indirectly through interaction with Shc or SHP2. Since Grb2 is constitutively associated with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the recruitment of Grb2 to the activated Kit resultes in the colocalization of Sos and Ras and the subsequent activation of Ras. This promotes the interaction of Ras with Raf serinethreonine kinase and then the activation of MEK (a MAP kinase kinase). MEK phosphorylates ERK (a MAP kinase), and ERK phosphorylates a number of substrates, including pp90rsk [33]. Imatinib mesylate also inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK [34]. This process is considered to be due to blocking of the Kit signaling by this drug. Thus, both major signaling pathways of Kit, the PI3K/Akt system and the Ras/MAP kinase cascade, are inhibited by imatinib mesylate.",

              "summary_text": "Raf may also be activated by Ras-independent elements and, in turn, propagates signals through diverse effectors that mediate proliferation, angiogenesis, metastases, and survival.5 Raf may be activated by signaling upstream or constitutively. Constitutive activation of Raf and Ras are indistinguishable in their potential to induce malignant transformation.6-8 Activating raf mutations have been identified in melanoma, thyroid, colon, and other cancers (Table 1).9-43 Furthermore, the disappointing clinical results of farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitors (FTIs) that were developed based on a flawed premise that they would effectively target malignancies with a high incidence of Ras mutation has led to scrutiny of signaling elements downstream of Ras, such as Raf, as therapeutic targets.44 This review highlights relevant information about the biology of Raf and novel strategies directed at exploiting this knowledge to more effectively treat malignant diseases. SIGNALING THROUGH THE MAPK PATHWAY The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival are receiving considerable attention as potential targets for anticancer strategies. 45,46 Recently, there has been a notable increase in efforts directed at targeting the MAPK pathway, which integrates a wide array of proliferative signals initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein- coupled receptors.47,48 The network of signals emanating from the MAPK pathway are transmitted by proteins that serve as chemical switches, cycling between phosphorylated (activated) and dephosphorylated (inactivated) states.49 These on and off switches are regulated by kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Activated signaling elements, in turn, phosphorylate amino acid residues on downstream signaling proteins in a cascade-like and expansive manner.50 Not only does the centrality of the MAPK pathway render its components important targets for therapeutic development, but many genes that encode for its critical signaling elements undergo mutations, constitutively activating downstream signaling elements and conferring the potential for transformation and autonomous growth.50-52 In addition to efforts directed at Ras, therapeutic strategies directed at the MAPK pathway are targeting the cascade of downstream effector proteins including Raf, MAPK kinase (MAPKK; also called MEK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK] kinase), and ERK. The Raf/MEK/ERK module (Fig 1) of the MAPK pathway, which is immediately downstream of Ras, may be less redundant and innately resistant to therapeutic manipulations compared with Ras (as discussed in the next section). The Unfilled Promise of Targeting Ras The Raf/MEK/ERK module of the MAPK pathway has been the focus of considerable attention because therapeutic efforts directed at Ras, which is situated at the apex of the MAPK pathway, have been disappointing.44 Ras belongs to a superfamily of guanine nucleotide triphosphatases (GTPases) that transmit proliferative and survival signals to the MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and other pathways (Figs 1 and 2). Three ras proto-oncogenes encode four 21-kd proteins, called p21ras or Ras (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B, resulting from two alternatively spliced K-Ras gene products), that are localized to the inner surface of the cell membrane.44 Of the three ras genes, K-ras mutations are most commonly found in solid malignancies, whereas N-ras mutations are encountered less often, and H-ras mutations are rarely encountered.53,54 Ras isoforms impart distinct biologic effects as a result of the potential of these proteins to differentially activitate critical effectors.55 After synthesis as inactive cytosolic propeptides, Ras undergoes a series of post-translational modifications at its carboxyl terminus that increase its hydrophobicity.56,57 These modifications render Ras functional and capable of lo...",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

These receptors are believed to transduce signals by phosphorylation on Tyr residues of several cellular substrates including insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins 1, 2, 3 and 4 (White 2003). A number of signalling pathways can be activated downstream of IRS proteins. Molecules containing Src homology 2 domain, including the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb-2, SHP2 and others, are recruited to the Tyr phosphorylated IRSs and transmit a cascade of signals, which consists in two major elements, i.e. Ras/Raf/p44-p42MAPK and PI3K/ Akt/p70S6K pathways (Virkamaki et al. 1999). More recently, p38MAPK, a parallel MAPK signal transduction pathway that becomes activated in response to cellular stresses (Nebreda & Porras 2000), has been shown to be stimulated by insulin in several cell systems including skeletal muscle (Conejo & Lorenzo 2001).",

AGF mutation in the phosphorylation site of the kinase.9 This mutant prevents hypoxia-induced activation of endogenous p38alpha MAPK.4 We predicted that inactivating p38alpha MAPK would diminish the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of p53. Accordingly, little p-p53(S15) was observed in the presence of p38alphaDN during H/R, corrected for modest change in total p53 protein concentration (Figure 2). Similarly, the use of a chemical inhibitor of p38alpha MAPK, SB203580 (SB), also attenuated p-p53(S15). Although SB inhibits both p38alpha and p38beta MAPKs, the latter is not activated by H/R stress alone, whereas the former is significantly up-regulated by the same stimulus.4 Therefore, SB is likely to inhibit p38alpha MAPK to a much greater degree than p38beta in H/R. Overall, these results indicate that H/R-induced p53 depends on p38alpha MAPK. ",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185].

More than a dozen mammalian MAP kinase family members have been discovered and include, among others, the well studied ERKs and several stress-sensitive enzymes. MAP kinases lie within protein kinase cascades. Each cascade consists of no fewer than three enzymes that are activated in series. Cascades convey information to effectors, coordinates incoming information from other signaling pathways, amplify signals, and allow for a variety of response patterns. Subcellular localization of enzymes in the cascades is an important aspect of their mechanisms of action and contributes to cell-type and ligand-specific responses. Recent findings on these properties of MAP kinase cascades are the major focus of this review.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

These data indicated that the activation of p38 MAPK by CO is PI3K/Akt-dependent. We next tested whether CO modulated STAT1 and STAT3 via PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. We pretreated PAEC with SB203580 and observed that CO can no longer modulate STAT1 or STAT3 activation (Fig. 2D, lane 5). Consistent with our data that PI3K/Akt activation is upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO during A-R (Fig. 2C), when we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, CO lost its ability to decrease STAT1 and increase STAT3 activation during A-R (Fig. 2D, lane 4). These data demonstrated that the opposing effect of CO on STAT1 and STAT3 activation is dependent upon PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. ",

However, this molecular mechanism of activation is not yet understood. We show here that endogenous TAK1 is constitutively associated with TAB1 and phosphorylated following IL-1 stimulation. Furthermore, TAK1 is constitutively phosphorylated when ectopically overexpressed with TAB1. In both cases, dephosphorylation of TAK1 renders it inactive, but it can be reactivated by preincubation with ATP. A mutant of TAK1 that lacks kinase activity is not phosphorylated either following IL-1 treatment or when coexpressed with TAB1, indicating that TAK1 phosphorylation is due to autophosphorylation. Furthermore, mutation to alanine of a conserved serine residue (Ser-192) in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII abolishes both phosphorylation and activation of TAK1. These results suggest that IL-1 and ectopic expression of TAB1 both activate TAK1 via autophosphorylation of Ser-192.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Although Ang II and HB-EGF induce angiogenesis, their link to the angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie2 system remains undefined. We tested the effects of Ang II on Ang1, Ang2, or Tie2 expression in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells expressing the Ang II receptors AT(1) and AT(2). Ang II significantly induced Ang2 mRNA accumulations without affecting Ang1 or Tie2 expression, which was inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitors and by intracellular Ca(2+) chelating agents. Ang II transactivated EGFR via AT(1), and inhibition of EGFR abolished the induction of Ang2. Ang II caused processing of pro-HB-EGF in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner to stimulate maturation and release of HB-EGF. Neutralizing anti-HB-EGF antibody blocked EGFR phosphorylation by Ang II. Ang II also upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in an HB-EGF/EGFR-dependent manner. AT(2) inhibited AT(1)-mediated Ang2 expression and phosphorylation of EGFR. In an in vivo corneal assay, AT(1) induced angiogenesis in an HB-EGF-dependent manner and enhanced the angiogenic activity of VEGF. Although neither Ang2 nor Ang1 alone induced angiogenesis, soluble Tie2-Fc that binds to angiopoietins attenuated AT(1)-mediated angiogenesis. These findings suggested that (1) Ang II induces Ang2 and VEGF expression without affecting Ang1 or Tie2 and (2) AT(1) stimulates processing of pro-HB-EGF by metalloproteinases, and the released HB-EGF transactivates EGFR to induce angiogenesis via the combined effect of Ang2 and VEGF, whereas AT(2) attenuates them by blocking EGFR phosphorylation. Thus, Ang II is involved in the VEGF-Ang-Tie2 system via HB-EGF-mediated EGFR transactivation, and this link should be considerable in pathological conditions in which collateral blood flow is required.",

We used a 2 x 2 factorial model, with two factors representing the IL-13 and the anti-EGFR effects, and a two-way interaction term for the interaction of IL-13 and anti-EGFR. The interaction term was used to identify transcripts that had a different response to IL-13 when anti-EGFR was present than when anti-EGFR was not present. We calculated estimated log ratios, moderated t statistics, log odds ratios of differential expression, and P values for each contrast of interest using functions in the Bioconductor package limma (24).

In this study, changes in both AQP5 and MUC5AC expression levels in SPC-A1, a human airway submucosal gland cell line, were quantified after exposure of the cells to LPS. AQP5 transcription and protein expression were decreased while MUC5AC expression was increased by LPS exposure in SPC-A1 cells. Further studies revealed that AQP5 expression was down-regulated via the p38/JNK signaling pathway, while MUC5AC was up-regulated through the EGFR-p38/JNK pathway. Therefore, p38 and JNK may become promising targets to preserve AQP5 expression and prevent MUC5AC over-expression to restore proper H(2)O to mucin ratio of the airway mucus, which may be beneficial to the clinical management of COPD patients.",

Cbp is located exclusively in so-called lipid rafts in which cholesterol, glycosphingolipid, and a variety of membrane-anchored signaling molecules including SFK accumulate. Lipid rafts are thus viewed as platforms for signaling across the membrane. The interaction of Cbp with Csk is also dependent upon the phosphorylation of its Tyr-314 by SFK (8-10). Based on these lines of evidence, a model of feedback regulation of SFK has been presented according to which activation of SFK by an extracellular stimulus leads to the phosphorylation of Cbp; this results in recruitment of Csk to lipid rafts and is followed by termination of SFK function (11-13).",

Holbro and N.E. Hynes, unpublished data). As a consequence, these cells have decreased PI-3K/PKB signaling, a reduction in D-type cyclin levels, and show an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A main effector of ErbB signaling, the PI-3K/PKB pathway, is particularly important in mediating cell survival 103 T. Holbro et al. / Experimental Cell Research 284 (2003) 99-110 since several PKB substrates directly control various apoptotic processes. The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

Moreover, these authors found that mono-phosphorylation of ATF2 Thr69 strongly reduces the phosphorylation rate of Thr71, whereas, in contrast, mono-phosphorylation of Thr71 does not reduce the rate of Thr69 phosphorylation. Thus, efficient phosphorylation of ATF2 by recombinant E.coli-expressed active p38 only occurs in the order Thr71-> Thr69 + 71 (Figure 7). ",

We reported previously that the hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein, known to be a causative agent in the formation of HCC, activates insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) expression through Sp1 phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In this report we demonstrate that the PTEN effect on HBx induced IGF-II activation in a hepatoma cell line. Expression of PTEN and IGF-II was inversely related in different hepatoma cell lines. PTEN expression induced decreased Sp1 DNA binding by dephosphorylating Sp1 and interfered with transcriptional transactivation of IGF-II by HBx in hepatoma cells. The protein phosphatase activity was involved in PTEN downregulation of IGF-II transcription through downregulation of MAPK, MAPK kinase phosphorylation and PKC translocation. Our data suggest that PTEN blocks Sp1 phosphorylation in response to HBx, by inactivating PKC, MAPK and MAPK kinase which eventually downregulate IGF-II expression, during the formation of HCC.",

Using pharmaceutical inhibitors and dominant active MAP kinase kinases, we demonstrated that activation of the p38 pathway, but not the ERK or JNK pathways, is necessary and sufficient to transactivate PPARgamma, a nuclear receptor that has recently been shown to play a pivotal role in oxLDL-induced CD36 expression. Our results for the first time demonstrate a regulation of CD36 by p38, and the importance of the p38 pathway in regulation of foam cell formation.",

Recent studies suggest that decreased aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is correlated with increased staining of MUC5AC in submucosal glands of COPD patients. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the major insults in airway mucin secretion in COPD. In this study, changes in both AQP5 and MUC5AC expression levels in SPC-A1, a human airway submucosal gland cell line, were quantified after exposure of the cells to LPS. AQP5 transcription and protein expression were decreased while MUC5AC expression was increased by LPS exposure in SPC-A1 cells. Further studies revealed that AQP5 expression was down-regulated via the p38/JNK signaling pathway, while MUC5AC was up-regulated through the EGFR-p38/JNK pathway. Therefore, p38 and JNK may become promising targets to preserve AQP5 expression and prevent MUC5AC over-expression to restore proper H(2)O to mucin ratio of the airway mucus, which may be beneficial to the clinical management of COPD patients.",

Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis.

ERK inhibition of long isoforms is regulated by a unique feedback control whereby elevated cAMP levels cause PKA (protein kinase A) to phosphorylate UCR1 and ablate the inhibitory action of ERK. PDE4 isoforms can also be found in complex with beta-arrestins where they provide a novel part of the cellular desensitization mechanism to receptor-mediated cAMP signalling. Stimulation of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor recruits beta-arrestins with bound PDE4, delivering an enzyme capable of degrading cAMP at its site of synthesis at the plasma membrane a major role of recruited PDE4 is to regulate plasma membrane PKA activity involved in phosphorylating the beta(2)-adrenoceptor.

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Hs766T cells express activated KRAS and display elevated levels of pERK1/2 and pAKT (Fig. 4C). Treatment of Hs766T cells with the PI3'-kinase inhibitor LY294002 led to a selective decrease in pAKT with little or no effect on pERK1/2. By contrast, treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or CI-1040 led to a selective decrease in pERK1/2 with little or no effect on pAKT. Strikingly, both the PI3'-kinase and the MEK inhibitors led to accumulation of p27Kip1 expression. These data are consistent with the observation that both MEK and PI3'-kinase inhibitors elicited a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in Hs766T cells (data not shown). Further consistent with these observations, treatment of a panel of pancreatic cancer cells (eight cell lines) (57) with a MEK inhibitor (U0126 or CI-1040) led to a consistent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest accompanied by induced expression of p27Kip1 in all eight cell lines tested (S. Gysin and M. McMahon, sub- mitted for publication). For the most part, treatment of cells with MEK inhibitors led to a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic effect, although cell death was often observed after prolonged treatment (+6 days). Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with LY294002 led in some cases to a cytostatic effect and in others to a more rapid cytotoxic effect. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 4C, inhibition of PI3'-kinase by LY294002 led to elevated p27Kip1 expression in five of eight pancreas cancer cell lines tested. These data are fully consistent with the hypothesis that the RAS-activated RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3'-kinase- PDK-AKT pathways play a role in the regulation of p27Kip1 expression in bona fide human cancer cell lines.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Grb2 may bind Kit either directly or indirectly through interaction with Shc or SHP2. Since Grb2 is constitutively associated with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the recruitment of Grb2 to the activated Kit resultes in the colocalization of Sos and Ras and the subsequent activation of Ras. This promotes the interaction of Ras with Raf serinethreonine kinase and then the activation of MEK (a MAP kinase kinase). MEK phosphorylates ERK (a MAP kinase), and ERK phosphorylates a number of substrates, including pp90rsk [33]. Imatinib mesylate also inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK [34]. This process is considered to be due to blocking of the Kit signaling by this drug. Thus, both major signaling pathways of Kit, the PI3K/Akt system and the Ras/MAP kinase cascade, are inhibited by imatinib mesylate.",

The kinase activity of Raf1 was required to reverse the pRb-mediated promoter repression (Wang et al., 1998), but the phosphorylation sites on pRb remain to be described and therefore are not indicated in the diagram.",
