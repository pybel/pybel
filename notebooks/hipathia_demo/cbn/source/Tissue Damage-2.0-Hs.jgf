If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

              "summary_text": " Stimulation with LPS also activates IRF3, and because LPS can induce the expression of both IFN- and IFN-inducible genes in a MyD88-independent manner, this indicates that IRF3 activation does not require MyD88. In fact, IRF3 activation, as shown by dimer formation and nuclear translocation, can be observed in MyD88-deficient cells47.  The activation of IRF3 by signalling through TLR3 is more rapid and potent than that triggered by TLR4 signalling, and this correlates with increased production of IFN- (S.A. and K.T., unpublished observations). Whereas activating TLR3 with poly I:C results in the C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF3, as detected using a phosphospecific antibody, stimulation with LPS does not induce detectable C-terminal phosphorylation70. However, we think that TLR3- and TLR4-mediated IRF3 activation probably differ quantitatively, rather than qualitatively, because it is more plausible that the phosphospecific antibody is not sensitive enough to detect IRF3 phosphorylation following TLR4 activation.  Two IKK-related proteins - IKK- (also known as inducible IKK, IKKi) and TBK1 (TRAF-family-member-associated NF-kB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1; also known as NF-kB-activating kinase, NAK) - have recently been identified as the kinases that phosphorylate IRF3 in response to viral infection and stimulation of TLR3 (Refs 71,72). Overexpression of IKK- or TBK1 activates the promoter of the IFN- gene and of IFN-inducible genes and induces the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of IRF3. In addition, siRNA targeting of IKK- and TBK1, but not of IKK-, was observed to considerably reduce the TRIF-dependent activation of a reporter gene containing an IRF DNA-binding motif and to decrease the viral induction of IFN-4 and IFN- reporter genes71, 72. Furthermore, analysis of TBK1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts confirmed the essential role of TBK1 in IRF3-dependent gene expression mediated by TLR3 and TLR4 signalling73.  NF-kB activation. MyD88-deficient mice still activate NF-kB in response to stimulation with LPS, although the kinetics are delayed compared with wild-type mice. However, the activation of NF-kB in response to LPS is completely abrogated in mice lacking both MyD88 and TRIF, demonstrating that TRIF is essential for NF-kB activation through the MyD88-independent pathway50. Transcriptional activation of the IFN- gene requires activation of both NF-kB and IRF3, and in contrast to inflammatory cytokine production - which requires both early- and late-phase NF-kB activation, mediated by MyD88 and TRIF, respectively - production of IFN- can be induced by TRIF-mediated late-phase NF-kB activation alone (Fig. 4).     Figure 4 |  TRIF-dependent induction of IFN-.  The amino-terminal region of TRIF (Toll/interleukin-1-receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon (IFN)-) interacts with both TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) and TBK1 (TRAF-family-member-associated nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1). TRIF-dependent activation of TBK1 leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3 (IFN-regulatory factor 3), and TRAF6 mediates NF-kB activation. RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1) mediates the NF-kB activation that is induced through the carboxy-terminal region of TRIF. Activation of both NF-kB and IRF3 contributes to the activation of the IFN- gene. IB, inhibitor of NF-kB; TLR, Toll-like receptor.  ",

Microbial-activated TL1A was in part mediated by TLR 1, 2, 4, and 9 signaling pathways and dependent on downstream p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1) [46]. Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis. Our group showed that TLR8 or TLR7/8 ligand (R848) can inhibit TL1A production in a dose dependent manner [47•].",

This protein interacts and thus activates TAK1 kinase. It has been shown that the C-terminal portion of this protein is sufficient for binding and activation of TAK1, while a portion of the N-terminus acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of TGF beta, suggesting that this protein may function as a mediator between TGF beta receptors and TAK1. This protein can also interact with and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14/p38alpha), and thus represents an alternative activation pathway, in addition to the MAPKK pathways, which contributes to the biological responses of MAPK14 to various stimuli. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.",

However, this molecular mechanism of activation is not yet understood. We show here that endogenous TAK1 is constitutively associated with TAB1 and phosphorylated following IL-1 stimulation. Furthermore, TAK1 is constitutively phosphorylated when ectopically overexpressed with TAB1. In both cases, dephosphorylation of TAK1 renders it inactive, but it can be reactivated by preincubation with ATP. A mutant of TAK1 that lacks kinase activity is not phosphorylated either following IL-1 treatment or when coexpressed with TAB1, indicating that TAK1 phosphorylation is due to autophosphorylation. Furthermore, mutation to alanine of a conserved serine residue (Ser-192) in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII abolishes both phosphorylation and activation of TAK1. These results suggest that IL-1 and ectopic expression of TAB1 both activate TAK1 via autophosphorylation of Ser-192.",

However, it is not clear whether TRAF6 mediates the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI. Therefore, we examined whether TRAF6 is implicated in the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI by using transient transfection of TRAF6 siRNA. Knockdown of TRAF6 abrogated not only the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI under unstimulated conditions (Fig. 7A) but also the phosphorylation of TAK1 and MKK3, a downstream effector of TAK1 induced by TGF-beta1 stimulation in MMC (Fig. 7B).

              "summary_text": "In IRAK1-deficient mice, cytokine production in response to IL-1 and LPS was diminished but not abolished25-27, whereas IRAK4-deficient mice showed virtually no response to IL-1, LPS or other bacterial components, demonstrating that IRAK4 has an important role in IL-1R/TLR signalling28. Recently, patients with an inherited IRAK4 deficiency have been identified29. These patients failed to respond to IL-1, to IL-18 or to stimulation of each of five TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9). Together, these results show that IRAK4 and its kinase activity are required for TLR signalling and that IRAK4 functions upstream of IRAK1.  TRAF6. TRAFs constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved adaptor proteins30. So far, six members of the TRAF family have been identified in mammals, and they are characterized by the presence of an N-terminal coiled-coil domain (known as TRAF-N) and a conserved C-terminal domain (known as TRAF-C). The N-terminal portion of most TRAF proteins contains a RING (really interesting new gene)-finger/zinc-finger region, which is essential for downstream signalling events, whereas the TRAF-C domain mediates self-association and interactions with upstream receptors and signalling proteins. TRAF6 functions as a signalling mediator for both the TNF-receptor superfamily and the TLR/IL-1R superfamily, interacting directly with members of the TNF-receptor superfamily (CD40 and TNF-related activation-induced cytokine receptor, TRANCER) or being coupled indirectly to TLR/IL-1R superfamily members through its association with IRAKs. The consensus sequence for the TRAF6-binding domain has been identified as P-X-E-X-X-(D/E/F/W/Y)31. This motif is found in CD40, TRANCER, and the IRAKs; three of these TRAF6-binding motifs are found in IRAK1, two in IRAK2 and one in IRAK-M.  TAK1 and TABs. The activation by TRAF6 of the transcription factors NF-kB and activator protein 1 (AP1) involves TAK1 and two adaptor proteins TAB1 and TAB2. TAK1 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family32, which has been shown to be essential for both IL-1/LPS- and TNF-induced NF-kB activation33. Two TAK1-binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2, have been identified34, 35. When co-expressed ectopically, TAB1 enhances the kinase activity of TAK1, indicating that TAB1 functions as an activator of TAK134. By contrast, TAB2 functions as an adaptor, linking TAK1 to TRAF6 and thereby facilitating TAK1 activation35. However, embryonic fibroblasts obtained from TAB2-deficient mice show no impairment in either IL-1/LPS- or TNF-induced activation of NF-kB36. Furthermore, a new TAB2-like molecule, TAB3, has been identified recently, and similar to TAB2, it has been shown to associate with TAK1 and activate NF-kB37. Co-transfection of SMALL INTERFERING RNAS (siRNAs) directed against both TAB2 and TAB3 inhibited both IL-1- and TNF-induced activation of TAK1 and NF-kB, indicating that TAB2 and TAB3 function redundantly as mediators of TAK1 activation.  It has been shown that UBIQUITYLATION has an important role in TAK1 activation and that TRAF6 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase38. TRAF6 can interact through its RING-finger domain with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (UBC13), and this UBC13-TRAF6 complex triggers TAK1 activation through the assembly of a lysine63-linked polyubiquitin chain39.  NF-kB. The NF-kB family of transcription factors is composed of five members - p65 (REL-A), REL-B, cytoplasmic (c) REL, p50 and p52 - which function as homo- and heterodimers. NF-kB dimers are usually sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by molecules of the inhibitor of NF-kB (IB) family. Activation of NF-kB involves the phosphorylation and proteolysis of the IB proteins and the concomitant release and nuclear translocation of the NF-kB factors. This acute activation process is mediated by the IB kinase (IKK) complex, which comprises two catalytic subunits - IKK- and IKK- (also kn...",

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

              "summary_text": "Because TRAF2 and RIP are essential effector molecules in TNFR1-mediated IKK activation7, 8 , we examined whether MEKK3 is required for TRAF2- and RIP-mediated NF-kappaB activation. RIP is critical for the activation of IKK, whereas TRAF2 recruits IKK into the TNFR complex7 . However, it is not clear how RIP activates IKK. Because MEKK3 was absolutely required for optimal IKK activation by TNF (Fig. 3a), one possibility was that MEKK3 is a key target molecule of RIP in TNF-induced IKK activation. We used RIP-/- and TRAF2-/- MEFs, both of which have defective TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, to investigate this possibility10, 11, 23 . If MEKK3 is a downstream target of TRAF2 and RIP, MEKK3-mediated NF-kappaB activation should not be affected in these cells. We found that transfection of Map3k3 into both RIP-/- and TRAF2-/- MEFs resulted in strong IKK activation, which was similar to that observed in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3e). Expression of Map3k3 in these cells also resulted in activation of the NF-kappaB reporter gene in RIP-/- and TRAF2-/- MEFs (Fig. 3f). In contrast, expression of cDNA encoding TRAF2 or RIP activated IKK in the wild-type but not in the MEKK3-/- MEFs (Fig. 3g). These data thus identified MEKK3 as a downstream effector kinase of TRAF2 and RIP in IKK and NF-kappaB activation.",

              "summary_text": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is tightly regulated by the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and plays a central role in regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic stress. Metformin has been shown to activate AMPK. We hypothesized that metformin may prevent nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines. Metformin was observed to activate AMPK, as well as its downstream target, phosphoacetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Metformin also dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB kinase activity. Furthermore, metformin attenuated the TNF-alpha-induced gene expression of various proinflammatory and cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in HUVECs. A pharmacological activator of AMPK, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced NF-kappaB reporter gene expression. AICAR also suppressed the TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced gene expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in HUVECs. The small interfering RNA for AMPKalpha1 attenuated metformin or AICAR-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha, suggesting a possible role of AMPK in the regulation of cell inflammation. In light of these findings, we suggest that metformin attenuates the cytokine-induced expression of proinflammatory and adhesion molecule genes by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation via AMPK activation. Thus, it might be useful to target AMPK signaling in future efforts to prevent atherogenic and inflammatory vascular disease.",

              "summary_text": "All living organisms are exposed constantly to microorganisms that are present in the environment and need to cope with invasion of these organisms into the body. The vertebrate immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity, with innate immunity being the first line of defence against pathogens. By contrast, acquired immune responses are slower processes, which are mediated by T and B cells, both of which express highly diverse antigen receptors that are generated through DNA rearrangement and are thereby able to respond to a wide range of potential antigens. This highly sophisticated system of antigen detection is found only in vertebrates and has been the subject of considerable research. Far less attention has been directed towards innate immunity, as it has been regarded as a relatively nonspecific system, with its main roles being to destroy pathogens and to present antigen to the cells involved in acquired immunity. However, recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has a greater degree of specificity than was previously thought and that it is highly developed in its ability to discriminate between self and foreign pathogens1. This discrimination relies, to a great extent, on a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have a crucial role in early host defence against invading pathogens1, 2. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response3, 4. This marked shift in our thinking has changed our ideas about the pathogenesis and treatment of cancers, and infectious, immune and allergic diseases. In the past few years, our knowledge of TLR signalling and the responses these receptors control has greatly increased. In this review, we discuss the TLRs, focusing on their signalling pathways.  TLR/IL-1R superfamily: structure and function  The discovery of the TLR family began with the identification of Toll, a receptor that is expressed by insects and was found to be essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis5. Subsequent studies revealed that Toll also has an essential role in the insect innate immune response against fungal infection6. Homologues of Toll were identified through database searches, and so far, 11 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a larger superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). By contrast, the extracellular region of the TLRs and IL-1Rs differs markedly: the extracellular region of TLRs contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, whereas the extracellular region of IL-1Rs contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 1a).     Figure 1 |  TLR structure and signalling.  a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) have a conserved cytoplasmic domain, that is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous regions (known as boxes 1, 2 and 3). Despite the similarity of the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules, their extracellular regions differ markedly: TLRs have tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions (known as leucine rich repeats, LRR), whereas IL-1Rs have three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. b | Stimulation of TLRs triggers the association of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88), which in turn recruits IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), thereby allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) is also recruited to the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1.

The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

This was further tested in human 293 cells in which the N-terminal region of IkappaBalpha was identified to be an important regulatory site for Bcl-2. Deletion of this region or a serine to alanine substitution mutant at amino acids 32 and 36, which are defective for both phosphorylation and degradation, were more resistant than wild type IkappaBalpha to the inhibitory effects of Bcl-2.

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The enhanced IkappaB degradation in cells with increased levels of BCL11B was specific for T-cells activated through the TCR, but not for cells activated through TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) or UV light, and was caused by increased activity of IkappaB kinase, as indicated by its increase in phosphorylation.

Although this event supports the efficient induction of immune responses, it might also interfere with processes that are susceptible to chronic inflammation, such as wound healing after tissue damage. Therefore, Gp96-mediated stimulation of the immune system requires tight regulation. Here we show that human thrombocytes specifically interact with Gp96 and that binding of Gp96 to platelets is enhanced more than 10-fold on activation by thrombin. Gp96 interferes with neither thrombin-induced platelet activation nor platelet aggregation. However, the presence of platelets during Gp96-mediated DC activation reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of DCs.",

Microbial-activated TL1A was in part mediated by TLR 1, 2, 4, and 9 signaling pathways and dependent on downstream p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1) [46]. Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis. Our group showed that TLR8 or TLR7/8 ligand (R848) can inhibit TL1A production in a dose dependent manner [47•].",

IKK is composed of three subunits-IKKalpha and IKKbeta, which are highly similar protein kinases, and IKKgamma, a regulatory subunit. In mammalian cells, phosphorylation of two sites at the activation loop of IKKbeta was essential for activation of IKK by tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1. Elimination of equivalent sites in IKKalpha, however, did not interfere with IKK activation. Thus, IKKbeta, not IKKalpha, is the target for proinflammatory stimuli. Once activated, IKKbeta autophosphorylated at a carboxyl-terminal serine cluster. Such phosphorylation decreased IKK activity and may prevent prolonged activation of the inflammatory response.",

              "summary_text": "Endocrine therapy with an estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted antiestrogen, such as tamoxifen, or estrogen ablation by aromatase inhibitors is clinically indicated for the management of all forms of ER-positive breast cancer. However, 30-50% of ER-positive breast cancer cases fail to benefit clinically from endocrine therapy alone, and recent molecular evidence suggests that 'crosstalk' pathways originating from activated receptor tyrosine kinases and/or other proliferative and survival signals may be contributing to this endocrine resistance. Molecular identification and validation of candidate ER crosstalking pathways will likely lead to clinically important prognostic markers and targets for the application of novel therapeutics in combination with standard endocrine agents. This review focuses on a critical survival and proliferation pathway involving activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that for nearly two decades have been known to be critical regulators of mammalian immune and inflammatory responses, and more recently have been associated with chemotherapy resistance. With the demonstration that activation of NFkappaB is absolutely required for normal mammary gland development, NFkappaB involvment in human breast cancers was initially explored and linked to the development of hormone-independent (ER-negative) breast cancer. Newer clinical evidence now implicates NFkappaB activation, particularly DNA-binding by the p50 subunit of NFkappaB, as a potential prognostic marker capable of identifying a high-risk subset of ER-positive, primary breast cancers destined for early relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen. Furthermore, initial preclinical studies suggest that treatment strategies designed to prevent or interrupt activation of NFkappaB in cell-line models of these more aggressive, ER-positive breast cancers can restore their sensitivity to such standard endocrine agents as tamoxifen.",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

              "summary_text": " Stimulation with LPS also activates IRF3, and because LPS can induce the expression of both IFN- and IFN-inducible genes in a MyD88-independent manner, this indicates that IRF3 activation does not require MyD88. In fact, IRF3 activation, as shown by dimer formation and nuclear translocation, can be observed in MyD88-deficient cells47.  The activation of IRF3 by signalling through TLR3 is more rapid and potent than that triggered by TLR4 signalling, and this correlates with increased production of IFN- (S.A. and K.T., unpublished observations). Whereas activating TLR3 with poly I:C results in the C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF3, as detected using a phosphospecific antibody, stimulation with LPS does not induce detectable C-terminal phosphorylation70. However, we think that TLR3- and TLR4-mediated IRF3 activation probably differ quantitatively, rather than qualitatively, because it is more plausible that the phosphospecific antibody is not sensitive enough to detect IRF3 phosphorylation following TLR4 activation.  Two IKK-related proteins - IKK- (also known as inducible IKK, IKKi) and TBK1 (TRAF-family-member-associated NF-kB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1; also known as NF-kB-activating kinase, NAK) - have recently been identified as the kinases that phosphorylate IRF3 in response to viral infection and stimulation of TLR3 (Refs 71,72). Overexpression of IKK- or TBK1 activates the promoter of the IFN- gene and of IFN-inducible genes and induces the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of IRF3. In addition, siRNA targeting of IKK- and TBK1, but not of IKK-, was observed to considerably reduce the TRIF-dependent activation of a reporter gene containing an IRF DNA-binding motif and to decrease the viral induction of IFN-4 and IFN- reporter genes71, 72. Furthermore, analysis of TBK1-deficient embryonic fibroblasts confirmed the essential role of TBK1 in IRF3-dependent gene expression mediated by TLR3 and TLR4 signalling73.  NF-kB activation. MyD88-deficient mice still activate NF-kB in response to stimulation with LPS, although the kinetics are delayed compared with wild-type mice. However, the activation of NF-kB in response to LPS is completely abrogated in mice lacking both MyD88 and TRIF, demonstrating that TRIF is essential for NF-kB activation through the MyD88-independent pathway50. Transcriptional activation of the IFN- gene requires activation of both NF-kB and IRF3, and in contrast to inflammatory cytokine production - which requires both early- and late-phase NF-kB activation, mediated by MyD88 and TRIF, respectively - production of IFN- can be induced by TRIF-mediated late-phase NF-kB activation alone (Fig. 4).     Figure 4 |  TRIF-dependent induction of IFN-.  The amino-terminal region of TRIF (Toll/interleukin-1-receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon (IFN)-) interacts with both TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) and TBK1 (TRAF-family-member-associated nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1). TRIF-dependent activation of TBK1 leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3 (IFN-regulatory factor 3), and TRAF6 mediates NF-kB activation. RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1) mediates the NF-kB activation that is induced through the carboxy-terminal region of TRIF. Activation of both NF-kB and IRF3 contributes to the activation of the IFN- gene. IB, inhibitor of NF-kB; TLR, Toll-like receptor.  ",

MEKK1 (MEK kinase-1) and MEKK3 have been implicated in the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK (27). To examine whether MEKK1 or MEKK3 is involved in the RIG-I/IPS-1 pathway, we performed an IFN-beta and NF-kappaB reporter assay using kinase-inactive mutants of MEKK1 (knMEKK1) and MEKK3 (knMEKK3). As shown in Fig. 4A, IPS-1- and RIG-IN-induced IFN-beta promoter and NF-kappaB activities were inhibited efficiently by knMEKK1 and to a lesser extent by knMEKK3. Next we examined the effect of overexpression of MEKK1 and MEKK3. The forced expression of IRF3, MEKK1, or MEKK3 alone was not sufficient for the activation of the IFN-beta promoter; however, cotransfection of IRF3 and MEKK1, but not MEKK3 synergistically activated the promoter activity (Fig. 4B). In order to confirm the significance of endogenous MEKK1 and MEKK3, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. Wild-type MEFs were transfected with scrambled control, MEKK1, or MEKK3 siRNA construct, and then endogenous gene expression of MEKK1 as well as MEKK3 was sufficiently suppressed (Fig. 4C). The knockdown of MEKK1, but not MEKK3, resulted in a severe reduction of IFN-beta mRNA expression induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 4C). Induction of mRNA for IP-10 was slightly suppressed in the MEKK1 knockdown MEFs. Significant reduction of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta levels by knockdown of MEKK1 with different siRNA oligonucleotides was also confirmed by real time PCR (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the suppression of type I IFNs by siRNA for MEKK1 was reverted by forced expression of rat MEKK1 (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that endogenous MEKK1 but not MEKK3 is required for type I IFN production induced by cytoplasmic dsRNA.",

              "summary_text": "All living organisms are exposed constantly to microorganisms that are present in the environment and need to cope with invasion of these organisms into the body. The vertebrate immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity, with innate immunity being the first line of defence against pathogens. By contrast, acquired immune responses are slower processes, which are mediated by T and B cells, both of which express highly diverse antigen receptors that are generated through DNA rearrangement and are thereby able to respond to a wide range of potential antigens. This highly sophisticated system of antigen detection is found only in vertebrates and has been the subject of considerable research. Far less attention has been directed towards innate immunity, as it has been regarded as a relatively nonspecific system, with its main roles being to destroy pathogens and to present antigen to the cells involved in acquired immunity. However, recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has a greater degree of specificity than was previously thought and that it is highly developed in its ability to discriminate between self and foreign pathogens1. This discrimination relies, to a great extent, on a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have a crucial role in early host defence against invading pathogens1, 2. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response3, 4. This marked shift in our thinking has changed our ideas about the pathogenesis and treatment of cancers, and infectious, immune and allergic diseases. In the past few years, our knowledge of TLR signalling and the responses these receptors control has greatly increased. In this review, we discuss the TLRs, focusing on their signalling pathways.  TLR/IL-1R superfamily: structure and function  The discovery of the TLR family began with the identification of Toll, a receptor that is expressed by insects and was found to be essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis5. Subsequent studies revealed that Toll also has an essential role in the insect innate immune response against fungal infection6. Homologues of Toll were identified through database searches, and so far, 11 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a larger superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). By contrast, the extracellular region of the TLRs and IL-1Rs differs markedly: the extracellular region of TLRs contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, whereas the extracellular region of IL-1Rs contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 1a).     Figure 1 |  TLR structure and signalling.  a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) have a conserved cytoplasmic domain, that is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous regions (known as boxes 1, 2 and 3). Despite the similarity of the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules, their extracellular regions differ markedly: TLRs have tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions (known as leucine rich repeats, LRR), whereas IL-1Rs have three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. b | Stimulation of TLRs triggers the association of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88), which in turn recruits IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), thereby allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) is also recruited to the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1.

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

However, it is not clear whether TRAF6 mediates the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI. Therefore, we examined whether TRAF6 is implicated in the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI by using transient transfection of TRAF6 siRNA. Knockdown of TRAF6 abrogated not only the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI under unstimulated conditions (Fig. 7A) but also the phosphorylation of TAK1 and MKK3, a downstream effector of TAK1 induced by TGF-beta1 stimulation in MMC (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that TRAF6 mediates the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI as well as TGF-beta1-induced TAK1 activation.",

We tested the requirement of these molecules in IL-17F–induced inflammatory gene expression. Induction of CXCL1 was impaired in TRAF6?/? MEFs upon IL-17F treatment (Fig. 2 C). Also, although WT MEFs up-regulated the expression of IL-6, CXCL-1, and the transcriptional regulators CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ? and I?B? upon IL-17F treatment, Act1-deficient MEFs did not (Fig. 2 D). Our results thus indicate that similar to IL-17, IL-17F requires both Act1 and TRAF6 for its signal transduction leading to inflammatory gene expression.",

IRAK-1 directly bound and phosphorylated IRF7 in vitro. The kinase activity of IRAK-1 was necessary for transcriptional activation of IRF7. LR7- and TLR9-mediated IFN-α production was abolished in Irak-1–deficient mice, whereas inflammatory cytokine production was not impaired. Despite normal activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases, IRF7 was not activated by a TLR9 ligand in Irak-1–deficient pDCs. These results indicated that IRAK-1 is a specific regulator for TLR7- and TLR9-mediated IFN-α induction in pDCs.",

              "summary_text": "The type-I interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) response is critical to immunity against viruses and can be triggered in many cell types by cytosolic detection of viral infection, or in differentiated plasmacytoid dendritic cells by the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) subfamily, which generates signals via the adaptor MyD88 to elicit robust IFN induction. Using mice deficient in the Irf7 gene (Irf7-/- mice), we show that the transcription factor IRF-7 is essential for the induction of IFN-alpha/beta genes via the virus-activated, MyD88-independent pathway and the TLR-activated, MyD88-dependent pathway. Viral induction of MyD88-independent IFN-alpha/beta genes is severely impaired in Irf7-/- fibroblasts. Consistently, Irf7-/- mice are more vulnerable than Myd88-/- mice to viral infection, and this correlates with a marked decrease in serum IFN levels, indicating the importance of the IRF-7-dependent induction of systemic IFN responses for innate antiviral immunity. Furthermore, robust induction of IFN production by activation of the TLR9 subfamily in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is entirely dependent on IRF-7, and this MyD88-IRF-7 pathway governs the induction of CD8+ T-cell responses. Thus, all elements of IFN responses, whether the systemic production of IFN in innate immunity or the local action of IFN from plasmacytoid dendritic cells in adaptive immunity, are under the control of IRF-7.",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

              "summary_text": "All living organisms are exposed constantly to microorganisms that are present in the environment and need to cope with invasion of these organisms into the body. The vertebrate immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity, with innate immunity being the first line of defence against pathogens. By contrast, acquired immune responses are slower processes, which are mediated by T and B cells, both of which express highly diverse antigen receptors that are generated through DNA rearrangement and are thereby able to respond to a wide range of potential antigens. This highly sophisticated system of antigen detection is found only in vertebrates and has been the subject of considerable research. Far less attention has been directed towards innate immunity, as it has been regarded as a relatively nonspecific system, with its main roles being to destroy pathogens and to present antigen to the cells involved in acquired immunity. However, recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has a greater degree of specificity than was previously thought and that it is highly developed in its ability to discriminate between self and foreign pathogens1. This discrimination relies, to a great extent, on a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have a crucial role in early host defence against invading pathogens1, 2. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response3, 4. This marked shift in our thinking has changed our ideas about the pathogenesis and treatment of cancers, and infectious, immune and allergic diseases. In the past few years, our knowledge of TLR signalling and the responses these receptors control has greatly increased. In this review, we discuss the TLRs, focusing on their signalling pathways.  TLR/IL-1R superfamily: structure and function  The discovery of the TLR family began with the identification of Toll, a receptor that is expressed by insects and was found to be essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis5. Subsequent studies revealed that Toll also has an essential role in the insect innate immune response against fungal infection6. Homologues of Toll were identified through database searches, and so far, 11 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a larger superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). By contrast, the extracellular region of the TLRs and IL-1Rs differs markedly: the extracellular region of TLRs contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, whereas the extracellular region of IL-1Rs contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 1a).     Figure 1 |  TLR structure and signalling.  a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) have a conserved cytoplasmic domain, that is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous regions (known as boxes 1, 2 and 3). Despite the similarity of the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules, their extracellular regions differ markedly: TLRs have tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions (known as leucine rich repeats, LRR), whereas IL-1Rs have three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. b | Stimulation of TLRs triggers the association of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88), which in turn recruits IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), thereby allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) is also recruited to the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1.

On the other hand, Pellino 1-induced NFkB activation was inhibited by a dominant negative, kinase-inactive TAK1 mutant (TAK1 DN; Official Gene symbol - MAP3K7), indicating that Pellino1 must function upstream of TAK1 (Fig. 4  b). In support of this conclusion, TAK1 can still activate NFkB in C-12, where Pellino 1 expression is greatly knocked down by RNA interference (Fig. 4  c). Taken together, the above results support the hypothesis that the Pellino 1-IRAK-IRAK4-TRAF6 signaling complex functions between the receptor complex (Complex I) and the TAK1 complex (Complex II). ",

These include the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88), IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs), transforming growth factor-(TGF-)-activated kinase (TAK1), TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), TAB2 and tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)15, 16.  MyD88. MyD88 was isolated originally as a gene that is induced rapidly during the IL-6-stimulated differentiation of M1 myeloleukaemic cells into macrophages17. The encoded protein has an amino (N)-terminal death domain (DD), which is separated from its carboxy (C)-terminal TIR domain by a short linker sequence. MyD88 was subsequently cloned as an adaptor molecule that functions to recruit IRAK to the IL-1R complex following stimulation with IL-1 (Refs 18-20). The association between MyD88 and IRAK is mediated through a DD-DD interaction. MyD88 forms homodimers through DD-DD and TIR-domain-TIR-domain interactions and exists as a dimer when recruited to the receptor complex21. Therefore, MyD88 functions as an adaptor linking TLRs/IL-1Rs with downstream signalling molecules that have DDs.  IRAK family. Four IRAKs - IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK4 and IRAK-M - showing distinct gene-expression patterns have been identified in mammals22. IRAKs contain an N-terminal DD and a central serine/threonine-kinase domain. IRAK1 and IRAK4 have intrinsic kinase activity, whereas IRAK2 and IRAK-M have no detectable kinase activity. The kinase activity of IRAK1 increases strongly following TLR/IL-1R stimulation, and its kinase domain is essential for signalling through nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB). However, kinase activity itself is not essential for signalling, because in IRAK1-deficient cells, the overexpression of a kinase-defective mutant of IRAK1 can strongly induce NF-kB activation23.  By contrast, the overexpression of IRAK4 does not result in robust NF-kB activation, yet the expression of a kinase-inactive mutant of IRAK4 inhibits IL-1-mediated NF-kB activation. It has also been shown that IRAK1 is a direct substrate of IRAK4 but not vice versa24.",

In support of this conclusion, TAK1 can still activate NFkB in C-12, where Pellino 1 expression is greatly knocked down by RNA interference (Fig. 4  c). Taken together, the above results support the hypothesis that the Pellino 1-IRAK-IRAK4-TRAF6 signaling complex functions between the receptor complex (Complex I) and the TAK1 complex (Complex II). ",

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

We and others have previously demonstrated that Ras activates the inherent transcriptional activation function of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Supportive of the importance of NF-kappaB in transformation, Ras-induced cellular transformation can be suppressed by expression of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or by dominant-negative forms of the upstream activator IkappaB kinase (IKK). However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) can be activated by non-bacterial agonists including saturated fatty acids. However, downstream signaling pathways activated by non-bacterial agonists are not known. Thus, we determined the downstream signaling pathways derived from saturated fatty acid-induced TLR4 activation. Saturated fatty acid (lauric acid)-induced NFkB activation was inhibited by a dominant negative (DN) mutant of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF6, or IkBa in macrophages (RAW264.7) and 293T cells transfected with TLR4 and MD-2. Lauric acid induced the transient phosphorylation of AKT. LY294002, PI3K(DN), or AKT(DN) inhibited NFkB activation, p65 transactivation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression induced by lauric acid or constitutively active (CA) TLR4. AKT(DN) blocked MyD88-induced NFkB activation suggesting that AKT is a MyD88-dependent downstream signaling component of TLR4. AKT(CA) was sufficient to induce NFkB activation and COX-2 expression. These results demonstrate that NFkB activation and COX-2 expression induced by lauric acid is at least partly mediated through TLR4/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In contrast, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT induced by LPS or lauric acid. DHA also suppressed NFkB activation induced by TLR4(CA), but not MyD88(CA) or AKT(CA) suggesting that the molecular targets of DHA are signaling components upstream of MyD88 and AKT. Together, these results suggest that saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids reciprocally modulate the activation of TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathways involving MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 and PI3K/AKT, and further suggest a possibility that TLR4-mediated target gene expression and cellular responses are also differentially modulated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.",

Microbial-activated TL1A was in part mediated by TLR 1, 2, 4, and 9 signaling pathways and dependent on downstream p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1) [46]. Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis.

Cse4p has a unique 135-amino-acid N terminus and a C-terminal histone-fold domain that is more than 60% identical to histone H3 and the mammalian centromere protein CENP-A. Cse4p and CENP-A have biochemical properties similar to H3 and probably replace H3 in centromere-specific nucleosomes in yeasts and mammals, respectively. In order to identify regions of Cse4p that distinguish it from H3 and confer centromere function, a systematic site-directed mutational analysis was performed. Nested deletions of the Cse4p N terminus showed that this region of the protein contains at least one essential domain. The C-terminal histone-fold domain of Cse4p was analyzed by changing Cse4p amino acids that differ between Cse4p and H3 to the analogous H3 residues. Extensive substitution of contiguous Cse4p residues with H3 counterparts resulted in cell lethality. However, all large lethal substitution alleles could be subdivided into smaller viable alleles, many of which caused elevated rates of mitotic chromosome loss. The results indicate that residues critical for wild-type Cse4p function and high-fidelity chromosome transmission are distributed across the entire histone-fold domain. Our findings are discussed in the context of the known structure of H3 within the nucleosome and compared with previous results reported for CENP-A.",

As shown in Fig. 4F, withHuR knockdown, no VCAM-1 can be detected in the ChIP assay in LPStreated cells, in shape contrast with LPS-treated control (NS siRNAtransfected) cellswhere a high level ofVCAM-1 was detected.

In contrast to macrophages which require c-Rel for p40 transcription, in CD8(+) dendritic cells, the induced expression of p35 rather than p40 by inactivated Staphylococcus aureus, DNA, or LPS is c-Rel dependent and regulated directly by c-Rel complexes binding to the p35 promoter. This data establishes the IL-12 p35 gene as a new target of c-Rel and shows that the regulation of IL-12 p70 expression at the transcriptional level by Rel/NF-kappaB is controlled through both the p35 and p40 genes in a cell type-specific fashion.",

              "summary_text": "The members of this family share a region of homology that spans the first 300 N-terminal amino acids known as the NF- k-B/Rel/dorsal region or Rel homology domain; it is responsible for dimerization, DNA binding, and nuclear translocation of NFk- B (Fig. 2) [211, 408-411]. The Rel homology domain consists of three regions, including a nuclear localization sequence, a DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization region [405]. Functional NF- kB is composed of dimers formed from p50, p52, Rel A (p65), Rel B, and c-Rel proteins [412-414]. In unstimulated cells, the nuclear localization sequence of NF-kB is bound to inhibitory proteins (IkB), thus maintaining it in the cytosol [415]. IkB proteins include IkBa [416] IkBb [417], IkBg [418,419], and possibly Bcl-3 [420,421]. Interestingly, the proteins previously believed to be precursor proteins of p50 and p52 known as p105 [422,423] and p100 [424] also exhibit IkB activity [424-426]. Recently, it was found that both p105 and p50 are generated from the same transcript but that the p105 protein is not actually a precursor of p50 [427]. The best studied of the IkB proteins is IkBa. Stimulation of cells leads to hyperphosphorylation of IkBaserines 32 and 36 [428-431] via activation of Nik, which phosphorylates IkB kinase (Fig. 2) [432-434]. Phosphorylation alone has no effect on the binding of the inhibitor to NF-kB [430,435,436]; however, it does provide a signal for ubiquitination at lysines 21 and 22 [437-439], which stimulates degradation of IkBaby the 26S proteasome complex. Dissociation of IkB and NF-kB proteins permits migration of the active NF-kB dimer to the nucleus [440], where it can bind to DNA and initiate transcription. ROS activate NF-kB by causing the release of the inhibitory subunit (IkB) from the NF-kB complex [11].",

Conversely, co-transfection of c-Fos and c-Jun encoding expression vectors potentiated the p65/NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation of the VCAM-1 promoter-CAT reporter gene. Furthermore the c-Fos encoding expression vector potentiated by 2-fold the transactivation activity of a chimeric transcriptional factor Gal/p65 (containing the transactivation domain of p65 and the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcriptional factor Gal-4).

To elucidate molecular mechanisms possibly linking these events, as well as to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the cyclopentenone prostaglandin A1 (PGA1), an inducer of heat shock proteins (HSPs), we exposed human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells to the complex I inhibitor rotenone. Dose-dependent apoptosis was preceded by the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and then the activation of caspase-3 over the ensuing 24 h. PGA1 increased the expression of HSP70 and HSP27 and protected against rotenone-induced apoptosis, without increasing necrotic death. PGA1 blocked the rotenone-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and attenuated, but did not abolish, the caspase-3 elevation. Unexpectedly, the caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD.CHO (DEVD), at a concentration that completely prevented the caspase-3 elevation produced by rotenone, failed to protect against apoptosis. These results suggest that complex I deficiency in dopamine cells can induce apoptosis by a process involving early NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and caspase-3 activation. PGA1 appears to protect against rotenone-induced cell death by inducing HSPs and blocking nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in a process that attenuates caspase-3 activation, but is not mediated by its inhibition.",

              "summary_text": "Endocrine therapy with an estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted antiestrogen, such as tamoxifen, or estrogen ablation by aromatase inhibitors is clinically indicated for the management of all forms of ER-positive breast cancer. However, 30-50% of ER-positive breast cancer cases fail to benefit clinically from endocrine therapy alone, and recent molecular evidence suggests that 'crosstalk' pathways originating from activated receptor tyrosine kinases and/or other proliferative and survival signals may be contributing to this endocrine resistance. Molecular identification and validation of candidate ER crosstalking pathways will likely lead to clinically important prognostic markers and targets for the application of novel therapeutics in combination with standard endocrine agents. This review focuses on a critical survival and proliferation pathway involving activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that for nearly two decades have been known to be critical regulators of mammalian immune and inflammatory responses, and more recently have been associated with chemotherapy resistance. With the demonstration that activation of NFkappaB is absolutely required for normal mammary gland development, NFkappaB involvment in human breast cancers was initially explored and linked to the development of hormone-independent (ER-negative) breast cancer. Newer clinical evidence now implicates NFkappaB activation, particularly DNA-binding by the p50 subunit of NFkappaB, as a potential prognostic marker capable of identifying a high-risk subset of ER-positive, primary breast cancers destined for early relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen. Furthermore, initial preclinical studies suggest that treatment strategies designed to prevent or interrupt activation of NFkappaB in cell-line models of these more aggressive, ER-positive breast cancers can restore their sensitivity to such standard endocrine agents as tamoxifen.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The enhanced IkappaB degradation in cells with increased levels of BCL11B was specific for T-cells activated through the TCR, but not for cells activated through TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) or UV light, and was caused by increased activity of IkappaB kinase, as indicated by its increase in phosphorylation.

The -300 bp CCL3 promoter and -222 bp CCL4 promoter were strongly up-regulated by co-transfection with the C/EBPb expression vector. Mutation of the C/EBPb motif and reduction of C/EBPb expression by siRNA decreased the up-regulation. Additionally, another cytokine-related transcription factor, NF-kB, was also shown to be involved in the up-regulation of chemokines in response to IL-1?, and the binding site was identified. The regulation of C/EBPb and NF-kB was confirmed by the inhibition by C/EBPb and NF-kB and by transfection with C/EBPk and NF-kB expression vectors in the presence or absence of IL-1b.",

Furthermore co-transfetcion of M1.CAT promoter (CSF promoter contains two tendem kB sites) with expression vector RSVp65 alone in bovine endothelial cells resulted in a 13 fold induction in M1 promoter compared to 5.7 fold with a combination of p65 and p50 and 2.2 fold induction with p50 alone.

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

This led us to examine the effect of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory compound that targets IkB kinase and has insulin-sensitizing effects [32]. Remarkably, aspirin dramatically decreased endotoxin-induced resistin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Both aspirin (via IkB kinase) and rosiglitazone (via PPARg) inhibit NF-kB [31,32], which is activated by LPS. Indeed, treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-kB activation [33], abrogated endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of the macrophages with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF-kB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation [34], nearly abolished endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (Figure 4D). Thus, activation of NF-kB is required for LPS induction of resistin in human macrophages.",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

A strong driving force in sustaining the long lasting efforts to understand the function and regulation of MYC is its potent role as an oncoprotein in human tumors. The first myc gene emerged almost 30 years ago when it was realized that several highly transforming chicken retroviruses had captured a cellular sequence that transformed myeloid cells among others, hence the name myc for myelomonocytic leukemia (1, 2). In mammals several MYC genes, includingMYC(formerly c-MYC, gene and protein symbols as proposed by the Human Genome Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/ index.html)), MYCN, and MYCL, have been identified. All three have been implicated in the genesis of human malignancies and suffer in many instances from different genetic alterations, including translocations and amplifications (for a more detailed overview see supplemental Fig. S1) (3, 4). In addition the MYC promoter is targeted by multiple signal transduction cascades, including the WNT, RAS/RAF/MAPK,2 JAK/STAT, transforming growth factor beta, and NF-kappaB pathways, that are deregulated in cancer cells and contribute to enhanced MYC expression (5, 6). These tumor-associated alterations in general deregulate and enhance MYC expression.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Phosphorylation by JNK increases the ability of c-Jun to activate AP-1-dependent transcription. To determine whether the sustained JNK activation that occurred in response to TNF and NF-kappaB inhibition resulted in increased c-Jun activation, AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity was measured in untreated and TNF treated cells. RALA hepatocytes were transiently transfected with the AP-1-driven firefly luciferase reporter construct Coll73-Luc, and the constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK for normalization. No significant increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity occurred in Ad5LacZ-infected cells at 4 hours after TNF treatment (Fig. 1B). AP-1 transcriptional activity in Ad5IkappaB-infected cells was increased slightly in untreated cells and almost 3-fold in cells treated with TNF (Fig. 1B). JNK overactivation resulting from NF-kappaB inactivation therefore led to increased AP-1-dependent transcription.",

Whereas the levels of MnSOD in vector cells were maintained in hyperoxia up to 2 d, the levels of MnSOD in DN I?B mutant cells were significantly reduced in prolonged hyperoxia (Fig. 5).

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

The role of NF-kappaB in the cumulative changes in gene expression with transformation and progression of the murine SCC Pam 212 and after switching off NF-kappaB by a dominant negative inhibitor kappaB mutant (IkappaBalphaM) was explored by profiling with a 15,000-element cDNA micoarrray. Remarkably, NF-kappaB modulated the expression of 60% of the 308 genes differentially expressed between normal keratinocytes and metastatic SCCs. NF-kappaB directly or indirectly modulated expression of programs of genes functionally linked to proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and angiogenesis. Among these, changes in expression of cyclin D1, inhibitor of apoptosis-1, mutant Trp53, and beta-catenin detected with modulation of NF-kappaB by microarray were confirmed by Western and Northern blot. NF-kappaB DNA binding motifs were detected in the promoter of approximately 63% of genes showing increased expression and 33% of the genes showing decreased expression. The ACTACAG motif implicated in the NF-kappaB-dependent down-regulation of mRNA expression of MyoD and Sox9 was detected in the coding portion of about 15% of genes showing increased or decreased expression. Inactivation of NF-kappaB inhibited malignant phenotypic features including proliferation, cell survival, migration, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. These results provide evidence that NF-kappaB is an important modulator of gene expression programs that contribute to the malignant phenotype of SCC.",

This led us to examine the effect of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory compound that targets IkB kinase and has insulin-sensitizing effects [32]. Remarkably, aspirin dramatically decreased endotoxin-induced resistin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Both aspirin (via IkB kinase) and rosiglitazone (via PPARg) inhibit NF-kB [31,32], which is activated by LPS. Indeed, treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-kB activation [33], abrogated endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of the macrophages with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF-kB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation [34], nearly abolished endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (Figure 4D).

              "summary_text": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is tightly regulated by the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and plays a central role in regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic stress. Metformin has been shown to activate AMPK. We hypothesized that metformin may prevent nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines. Metformin was observed to activate AMPK, as well as its downstream target, phosphoacetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Metformin also dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB kinase activity. Furthermore, metformin attenuated the TNF-alpha-induced gene expression of various proinflammatory and cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in HUVECs. A pharmacological activator of AMPK, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced NF-kappaB reporter gene expression. AICAR also suppressed the TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced gene expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in HUVECs. The small interfering RNA for AMPKalpha1 attenuated metformin or AICAR-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha, suggesting a possible role of AMPK in the regulation of cell inflammation. In light of these findings, we suggest that metformin attenuates the cytokine-induced expression of proinflammatory and adhesion molecule genes by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation via AMPK activation. Thus, it might be useful to target AMPK signaling in future efforts to prevent atherogenic and inflammatory vascular disease.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Genes were grouped in categories based upon their physiological functions or properties. Gene accession numbers are in the far left column adjacent to their names and descriptions. In the first data column, -fold changes of genes identified in two independent primary microarray screens of WT MEFs compared with WT. MEFs constitutively expressing the Ikappa Balpha (SS32/36AA) superrepressor are provided. In data columns 2-4, the dependences of each of these genes on IKKalpha , NEMO/IKKgamma , and IKKbeta were determined in six independent microarray screens wherein WT MEFs were compared with mutant MEFs null for the individual IKK subunits. -Fold change values from duplicate screenings were listed together. Dependence on one or more signalsome subunits was stringently evaluated by adhering to two criteria: wild type MEF absolute calls of \\\"present\\\" (P) and \\\"increase\\\" (I) average difference calls. Each screen was performed with cells stimulated for 2 h with 10 ng/ml human TNFalpha . Genes that were dependent on basal NF-kappa B for their expression were identified by performing independent microarray screens in the absence of TNFalpha stimulation. Redundancy hits (corresponding to different oligonucleotide regions of the same gene) are noted in the gene description column. NC denotes a \\\"no change\\\" average difference call, indicating no significant dependence on that IKK subunit. Results of exposure to TNFalpha are presented in the indicated column as follows: - (no significant effect), +/- (~2-5-fold stimulation), and + (>10-fold stimulated). Two independent screens were conducted in all cases with similar results.",

Overexpression of p50 and p65 decreased BHMT promoter activity, while blocking NF-kappaB activation increased BHMT expression and promoter activity, and prevented SAM but not MTA's ability to inhibit BHMT expression.

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The avb3 integrin promotes endothelial and melanoma cell survival; this effect correlates with suppression of the p53 pathway and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B transcription factor (56). The activation of Shc by a1b1, a5b1, and avb3 may also contribute to protection from apoptosis (4, 17).

TNF-{alpha} (5 ng/ml, 30 min) treatment was used as a positive control. A time-dependent increase in binding with a [32P]NF-{kappa}B probe was observed, with optimal binding seen after 30 min. Binding started to decrease after 60 min, with basal levels reached by 120 min. Specific NF-{kappa}B binding was competed out with excess unlabeled probe (Fig. 8B). Specific localization of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-{kappa}B complex involved in promoter binding was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Fibroblasts in eight-well chamber slides were treated with 1% CSE for 1 h and then stained for p50 and p65 (Fig. 8C). Fibroblasts treated with medium alone had a diffuse p50 and p65 staining in the cytoplasm, and only weak staining was observed in the nucleus, explaining NF-{kappa}B basal binding observed during EMSA analysis. CSE treatment led to translocation of both subunits observed as increased staining in the nucleus (shown by arrows) and decreased cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 8C). These data support a role for NF-{kappa}B in CSE-induced COX-2 production.",

LPS stimulation induces NADPH oxidase activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PMNs as well as the initiation of MyD88-dependent NF-ÃŽÂºB signaling in endothelial cells and the consequent expression of TLR2 and ICAM-1. Adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMNs to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells. The oxidants augment NF-ÃŽÂºB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells and increased PMN migration. Thus, the PMN NADPH oxidaseÃ¢â‚¬â€œmediated TLR4-TLR2 cross talk activates a positive feedback signal leading to sustained and amplified endothelial activation in response to invading pathogens.",

However, the molecular mechanism of this pathway remains unclear. In this report we demonstrate that both NIK and IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) are involved in LTbetaR signaling and that the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit at serine 536 in its transactivation domain 1 (TA1) plays an essential role. We also found that NF-kappaB could be activated in the LTbetaR pathway without altering the level of the phosphorylation of IkappaB and nuclear localization of p65. By using a heterologous transactivation system in which Gal4-dependent reporter gene is activated by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in fusion with various portions of p65, we found that TA1 serves as a direct target in the NIK-IKKalpha pathway. In addition, mutation studies have revealed the essential role of Ser-536 within TA1 of p65 in transcriptional control mediated by NIK-IKKalpha. Furthermore, we found that Ser-536 was phosphorylated following the stimulation of LTbetaR, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by the kinase-dead dominant-negative mutant of either NIK or IKKalpha. These observations provide evidence for a crucial role of the NIK-IKKalpha cascade for NF-kappaB activation in LTbetaR signaling.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "To determine whether p300 is involved in inducible NO synthase (iNOS) transcriptional regulation, we evaluated the effect of p300 overexpression on iNOS expression and characterized p300 binding to iNOS promoter in RAW 264.7 cells. p300 overexpression increased iNOS expression which was abrogated by deletion of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain (Delta1472-1522). DNA-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed binding of p300 to several DNA-bound transactivators at basal state. Following stimulation with LPS plus IFN-gamma, binding of p300, p50/p65 NF-kappaB, and IFN-regulatory factor-1 was increased by approximately 2-fold. Nuclear p50 was complexed with and acetylated by p300 at the basal binding state which was increased by LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation. p300 overexpression resulted in increased p50 acetylation which was reduced by HAT mutation. p50 acetylation correlated with increased NF-kappaB binding and enhanced p300 recruitment. Co-overexpression of E1A abolished the augmentation of p50 acetylation and p50 binding induced by p300 overexpression, and a correlative suppression of p300 recruitment to the complex. We conclude that p300 is essential for iNOS transcription. Our results suggest that p300 HAT acetylates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, thereby increasing NF-kappaB binding and NF-kappaB mediated transactivation.",

We show that activation of NF-kappaB, through muscle-specific transgenic expression of activated IkappaB kinase beta (MIKK), causes profound muscle wasting that resembles clinical cachexia. In contrast, no overt phenotype was seen upon muscle-specific inhibition of NF-kappaB through expression of IkappaBalpha superrepressor (MISR). Muscle loss was due to accelerated protein breakdown through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Expression of the E3 ligase MuRF1, a mediator of muscle atrophy, was increased in MIKK mice. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB/MuRF1 pathway reversed muscle atrophy. Denervation- and tumor-induced muscle loss were substantially reduced and survival rates improved by NF-kappaB inhibition in MISR mice, consistent with a critical role for NF-kappaB in the pathology of muscle wasting and establishing it as an important clinical target for the treatment of muscle atrophy. We show that activation of NF-kappaB, through muscle-specific transgenic expression of activated IkappaB kinase beta (MIKK)... Expression of the E3 ligase MuRF1, a mediator of muscle atrophy, was increased in MIKK mice.",

              "summary_text": "In order to identify genes associated with metastasis, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed using murine osteosarcoma cell line Dunn and its subline with higher metastatic potential, LM8. SSH revealed expression of the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP; also known as p97) to be constitutively activated in LM8 cells, but it declined in Dunn cells when the cells became confluent. Because VCP is known to be involved in the ubiquitination process of Inhibitor-kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), an inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), whether VCP influences NFkappaB activation or not was examined by using VCP-transfected Dunn cells (Dunn/VCPs). When stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), Dunn/VCPs showed constantly activated NFkappaB, although in the original Dunn cells and control vector transfectant (Dunn/Dunn-c) NFkappaB activation ceased when the cells became confluent. Western immunoblot analysis showed an increase of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha (p-IkappaBalpha) in the cytoplasm of confluent Dunn/Dunn-c cells compared to that of Dunn/VCPs. Therefore, decrease of p-IkappaBalpha degrading activity might be responsible for the decrease in NFkappaB activation. In vitro apoptosis assay demonstrated increased apoptosis rates of Dunn/Dunn-c cells after TNFalpha stimulation compared to those of Dunn/VCPs and LM8 cells. In vivo metastasis assay showed increased incidences of metastatic events in Dunn/VCP-1 inoculated male C3H mice compared to those in Dunn/Dunn-c inoculated mice. These findings suggested that VCP expression plays an important role in the metastatic process. Anti-apoptotic potential in these cells owing to constant NFkappaB activation via efficient cytoplasmic p-IkappaBalpha degrading activity may explain the increased metastatic potential of these cells.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

LOX-1 activation also plays an important role in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. A number of studies show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce total LDL cholesterol and exert a cardioprotective effect. We examined the modulation of LOX-1 expression and its function by two different statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin, in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). We observed that ox-LDL (40 microg/ml) treatment up-regulated the expression of E- and P-selectins, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in HCAECs. Ox-LDL mediated these effects via LOX-1, since antisense to LOX-1 mRNA decreased LOX-1 expression and subsequent adhesion molecule expression. Pretreatment of HCAECs with simvastatin or atorvastatin (1 and 10 microM) reduced ox-LDL-induced expression of LOX-1 as well as adhesion molecules (all P microM) was more potent than the low concentration (1 microM) (P Both statins reduced ox-LDL-mediated activation of the redox-sensitive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) but not AP-1. These observations indicate that LOX-1 activation plays an important role in ox-LDL-induced expression of adhesion molecules. Inhibition of expression of LOX-1 and adhesion molecules and activation of NF-kappaB may be another mechanism of beneficial effects of statins in vascular diseases.",

              "summary_text": "All living organisms are exposed constantly to microorganisms that are present in the environment and need to cope with invasion of these organisms into the body. The vertebrate immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity, with innate immunity being the first line of defence against pathogens. By contrast, acquired immune responses are slower processes, which are mediated by T and B cells, both of which express highly diverse antigen receptors that are generated through DNA rearrangement and are thereby able to respond to a wide range of potential antigens. This highly sophisticated system of antigen detection is found only in vertebrates and has been the subject of considerable research. Far less attention has been directed towards innate immunity, as it has been regarded as a relatively nonspecific system, with its main roles being to destroy pathogens and to present antigen to the cells involved in acquired immunity. However, recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has a greater degree of specificity than was previously thought and that it is highly developed in its ability to discriminate between self and foreign pathogens1. This discrimination relies, to a great extent, on a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have a crucial role in early host defence against invading pathogens1, 2. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response3, 4. This marked shift in our thinking has changed our ideas about the pathogenesis and treatment of cancers, and infectious, immune and allergic diseases. In the past few years, our knowledge of TLR signalling and the responses these receptors control has greatly increased. In this review, we discuss the TLRs, focusing on their signalling pathways.  TLR/IL-1R superfamily: structure and function  The discovery of the TLR family began with the identification of Toll, a receptor that is expressed by insects and was found to be essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis5. Subsequent studies revealed that Toll also has an essential role in the insect innate immune response against fungal infection6. Homologues of Toll were identified through database searches, and so far, 11 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a larger superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). By contrast, the extracellular region of the TLRs and IL-1Rs differs markedly: the extracellular region of TLRs contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, whereas the extracellular region of IL-1Rs contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 1a).     Figure 1 |  TLR structure and signalling.  a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) have a conserved cytoplasmic domain, that is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous regions (known as boxes 1, 2 and 3). Despite the similarity of the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules, their extracellular regions differ markedly: TLRs have tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions (known as leucine rich repeats, LRR), whereas IL-1Rs have three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. b | Stimulation of TLRs triggers the association of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88), which in turn recruits IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), thereby allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) is also recruited to the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1.

Increased GRK2 and GRK5 expression results in chemokine receptor internalization and desensitization, thereby negatively regulating PMN migration. Thus, PI3K-?-activated signaling is postulated to be a feedback mechanism regulating PMN migration. Because persistent infection requires continued PMN infiltration, LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling pathway transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response to MIP-2. This decreases chemokine receptor desensitization by preventing CXCR2 internalization and thus augments PMN migration. MEK kinase is involved in mediating the crosstalk between TLR4 and chemokine receptors. Dashed lines indicate inhibitory signals.",

              "summary_text": "However, because leptin improved insulin sensitivity in rodents (61) and in humans (62) with lipodystrophy, this makes it an unlikely contributor to the inflammatory response associated with obesity. Resistin was originally reported as an adipose tissue-specific hormone that provided a link between obesity and diabetes. Resistin is part of a new class of cysteine-rich secreted proteins that were found, by one of the groups who discovered it, to be induced during lung inflammation (found in inflammatory zone 1 [FIZZ1]). In vitro studies have shown that resistin mRNA expression is increased by proinflammatory cytokines in human mononuclear cells (63) and that resistin has a direct proinflammatory effect, probably mediated through nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) signaling pathway on vascular endothelial human cells (64). In rodents, resistin affects glucose tolerance and is related with whole-body and hepatic insulin resistance (65,66). Differences in resistin gene expression have been observed between human and mice tissues. While in mice adipocytes are the mayor source of circulating resistin, in humans secretion or expression is predominantly found in mononuclear cells, and the release of resistin by explants of adipose tissue in primary culture is largely derived from the nonfat cells present in the explants (67). Resistin is detectable in human serum, and its circulating levels were found to be elevated in proportion to the degree of adiposity (68,69). Although these data might suggest a contribution of resistin to inflammation and insulin resistance, the role of resistin in obesity has not been proven (68,69). Finally, other proinflammatory adipokines, such as complement C3 and macrophage inhibitor factor, were inversely and independently associated with insulin sensitivity (70,71). Adiponectin is the anti-inflammatory adipokine that has been studied most extensively. It is produced exclusively by white adipocytes but is paradoxically lower in obese versus lean individuals (72). Adiponectin has been related to insulin resistance and diabetes not only because of its AMP-activated protein kinase effects on FFA metabolism and glucose uptake but also because of its anti-inflammatory properties. Inhibition of phagocyte activity and TNF-alpha production by macrophages and inhibition of the TNF-alpha- induced expression of adhesion molecules (through NF-kappaB signaling pathways) are some of the known mechanisms by which adiponectin mediate its anti-inflammatory effects (73). Many studies have now suggested that in humans adiponectin is more closely related to insulin resistance than to obesity (73). Prospective and longitudinal studies (74 -78) have found a correlation between low adiponectin levels and a higher risk of diabetes, independent of many confounders including obesity and other inflammatory markers (75,79). Krakoff et al. (79) hypothesized that in studies in which substantial baseline differences in the degree of adiposity exist, the predictive value of inflammatory markers may be a result of their association with obesity, i.e., they may be acting as surrogate markers of hypoadiponectinemia and may be only indirectly associated with the development of diabetes (Fig. 1B) (Table 2). Adipose tissue is also a source of other anti-inflammatory cytokines whose roles are mostly unknown. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by immune cells (T-helper, B-cells, and macrophages). In mice, IL-10 treatment prevented IL-6-induced defects in both hepatic and skeletal insulin action (56). Circulating IL-10 is elevated in human obesity (80); in adipose tissue, IL-10 is primarily produced by nonfat cells (81). In humans, lower serum concentrations of IL-10 were associated with the metabolic syndrome (80) and with diabetes (82).

The mice were also less sensitive to the effects on CYP3A11 and CYP1A2, but the activities for these isozymes in the indomethacin-treated mice were still lower than in untreated mice. Immunoblot analysis with anti-CYP3A2 and anti-CYP2D2 sera indicated that indomethacin-induced decreases in expression of the proteins recognized by the antibodies were attenuated in the LPS-resistant mice. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Toll-like receptor 4 is involved in the indomethacin-induced down-regulation of hepatic CYP enzymes, indicating the pivotal role of gut-derived endotoxin in the hepatic effects.",

PTX3 is made by diverse cell types, most prominently endothelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, in response to primary inflammatory signals (e.g. interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). It binds diverse ligands, including microbial moieties, C1q and apoptotic cells.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is known to associate with dectin-1, TLR4 and ITAM receptors and regulate leukocyte cytoskeleton and Fc?R-dependent phagocytosis20-24. Yeast two-hybrid experiments, shown in Figure 3A, demonstrated that Syk can directly bind to the C-terminal domain of TLR4 and that this interaction was mediated by the N-terminal SH2 domain in the Syk molecule. We also found that mmLDL stimulated TLR4 phosphorylation (Figure 3B), suggesting that the mmLDL activation leads to an increased Syk SH2 domain binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues of TLR4. These results agree with our recent findings that mmLDL induced co-immunoprecipitation of TLR4 and Syk in a time-dependent manner as well as TLR4-dependent Syk phosphorylation24. Next, we generated a J774 line expressing Syk shRNA, which had no detectable Syk protein expression. The Syk-knockdown cells accumulated significantly less fluorescent dextran when activated with mmLDL, results fully replicated by the addition of 15LO-CE alone (Figure 3C)",

In the present study, we directly demonstrate binding of hsp60 to the macrophage surface and find the binding receptor for hsp60 different from the previously described common receptor for several other heat shock proteins, including hsp70, hsp90, and gp96. Fluorescence-labeled human hsp60 bound to cell surfaces of the murine macrophage lines J774 A.1 and RAW264.7 and to mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. By flow cytometry, we could demonstrate for the first time that hsp60 binding to macrophages occurred at submicromolar concentrations, is saturable, and can be competed by unlabeled hsp60, but not by unrelated proteins, thus confirming the classic characteristics of specific ligand-receptor interactions. Binding of hsp60 at 4 degrees C was followed by endocytosis at 37 degrees C. Hsp60 binding to macrophages could not be competed by excess hsp70, hsp90, or gp96, all of which share the alpha(2)-macroglobulin receptor as binding site. Hsp60 binding occurred in the absence of surface TLR4. However, no cytokine response was induced by hsp60 in TLR4-deficient macrophages. We conclude that hsp60 binds to a stereo-specific receptor on macrophages, and that different surface molecules are engaged in binding and signal transduction. Furthermore, the binding site for hsp60 is separate from the common receptor for hsp70, hsp90, and gp96, which suggests an independent role of hsp60 as danger Ag and in immunoregulation.",

Increased GRK2 and GRK5 expression results in chemokine receptor internalization and desensitization, thereby negatively regulating PMN migration. Thus, PI3K-?-activated signaling is postulated to be a feedback mechanism regulating PMN migration. Because persistent infection requires continued PMN infiltration, LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling pathway transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response to MIP-2. This decreases chemokine receptor desensitization by preventing CXCR2 internalization and thus augments PMN migration. MEK kinase is involved in mediating the crosstalk between TLR4 and chemokine receptors. Dashed lines indicate inhibitory signals.",

LPS stimulation induces NADPH oxidase activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PMNs as well as the initiation of MyD88-dependent NF-ÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂºB signaling in endothelial cells and the consequent expression of TLR2 and ICAM-1. Adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMNs to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells. The oxidants augment NF-ÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂºB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells and increased PMN migration.

Recently, the potential interaction of TL1A in microbial-host interaction was illustrated by a report showing microbial organisms can induce TL1A in APCs [46]. Microbial-activated TL1A was in part mediated by TLR 1, 2, 4, and 9 signaling pathways and dependent on downstream p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1) [46]. Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis. Our group showed that TLR8 or TLR7/8 ligand (R848) can inhibit TL1A production in a dose dependent manner [47•].",

Although this event supports the efficient induction of immune responses, it might also interfere with processes that are susceptible to chronic inflammation, such as wound healing after tissue damage. Therefore, Gp96-mediated stimulation of the immune system requires tight regulation. Here we show that human thrombocytes specifically interact with Gp96 and that binding of Gp96 to platelets is enhanced more than 10-fold on activation by thrombin. Gp96 interferes with neither thrombin-induced platelet activation nor platelet aggregation. However, the presence of platelets during Gp96-mediated DC activation reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of DCs.",

              "summary_text": "Endocrine therapy with an estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted antiestrogen, such as tamoxifen, or estrogen ablation by aromatase inhibitors is clinically indicated for the management of all forms of ER-positive breast cancer. However, 30-50% of ER-positive breast cancer cases fail to benefit clinically from endocrine therapy alone, and recent molecular evidence suggests that 'crosstalk' pathways originating from activated receptor tyrosine kinases and/or other proliferative and survival signals may be contributing to this endocrine resistance. Molecular identification and validation of candidate ER crosstalking pathways will likely lead to clinically important prognostic markers and targets for the application of novel therapeutics in combination with standard endocrine agents. This review focuses on a critical survival and proliferation pathway involving activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that for nearly two decades have been known to be critical regulators of mammalian immune and inflammatory responses, and more recently have been associated with chemotherapy resistance. With the demonstration that activation of NFkappaB is absolutely required for normal mammary gland development, NFkappaB involvment in human breast cancers was initially explored and linked to the development of hormone-independent (ER-negative) breast cancer. Newer clinical evidence now implicates NFkappaB activation, particularly DNA-binding by the p50 subunit of NFkappaB, as a potential prognostic marker capable of identifying a high-risk subset of ER-positive, primary breast cancers destined for early relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen. Furthermore, initial preclinical studies suggest that treatment strategies designed to prevent or interrupt activation of NFkappaB in cell-line models of these more aggressive, ER-positive breast cancers can restore their sensitivity to such standard endocrine agents as tamoxifen.",

In the death receptor pathway, ligands such as tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), FAS ligand (also known as CD95L), or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, also known as APO2 ligand (APO2L) or TNF ligand superfamily member 10 (TNFSF10)) interact with their respective death receptors (TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), FAS (also known as CD95) and death receptor 4 (DR4, also known as TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAILR1)) or DR5 (also known as TRAILR2), respectively). These interactions ultimately lead to the recruitment of the FAS-associated death domain (FADD) and the activation of the protease caspase 8. Caspase 8 cleaves and activates caspase 3 and other downstream caspases, which results in a proteolytic cascade that gives rise to the cell death phenotype characterized by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing.",

To conclusively demonstrate the involvement of SphK1, we also used pharmacological and genetic approaches.
