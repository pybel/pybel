If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

Ttf1+/- mice have also poor coordination and increased serum TSH concentration (205 +/- 22 vs. 92 +/- 12 mU/liter; P < 0.001) and slightly lower T4 (46 +/- 3 vs. 63 +/- 6 nmol/liter; P < 0.02) as compared with Ttf1+/+ mice. To determine whether the hypothyroidism is of central or primary origin, we examined the bioactivity of TSH, thyroidal response to exogenous TSH and the expression of genes regulated by TTF1. TSH bioactivity was normal, but T4 response to a low but not high dose of TSH was significantly reduced in the Ttf1+/- mice (5.5 +/- 2.2 vs. 15.3 +/- 4.1 nmol/liter; P < 0.03), indicating a reduced thyroidal response. Thyroid mRNAs were measured by real-time PCR (Ttf1+/+ littermates = 100%). Ttf1+/- mice had half the levels of TTF1 mRNA (54 +/- 9; P < 0.01) and protein, confirming their haploinsufficiency. Significantly lower levels of mRNAs were observed for two of the three genes with TTF1 cis elements: TSH receptor (TSHr, 57 +/- 4%; P < 0.002), thyroglobulin (63 +/- 7%; P < 0.005), but not thyroid peroxidase (81 +/- 12%; P > 0.05). No significant difference between the two genotypes was found for Pax8, sodium iodide symporter, and iodothyronine deiodinase 1. These results show that Ttf1 haploinsufficiency causes a reduction in the expression of TSHr and thyroglobulin, genes with TTF1 binding sites in their promoter regions. The low TSHr is only partially compensated by an increase in TSH secretion because T4 remains mildly reduced. However, administration of a larger amount of TSH obliterates the response differences by saturating a reduced amount of receptor.",

However, we observed cooperative effects of RAF and AKT on the expression of two key cell cycle regulators, cyclin D1 and p27Kip1. Activation of AKT or RAF alone led to a two- or threefold induction of cyclin D1 expression, respectively (Fig. 2A).",

Upon growth factor stimulation, Akt is activated, directly phosphorylating FKHRL1 at T32 and S253, and to a lesser extent at S315, and resulting in FKHRL1 relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ....  Similar AKT-dependent changes in subcellular localization have also been observed for the additional FKHRL1 human homologs AFX and FKHR.... Phosphorylation at T32 and S253 causes FKHRL1 to bind to 14-3-3, suggesting that the interaction between FKHRL1 and 14-3-3 may play an important role in regulating the subcellular localization of the complex.",

We found that SU5402 and LY294002 significantly reduced Elf5 expression, whereas U0126 had no effect. LY294002 also reduced Elf5 expression in cultures of purified epithelium. Finally, pAkt was coexpressed with Elf5 in the proximal epithelial airways of E17.5 lungs. These results demonstrate that Elf5 is an FGF-sensitive transcription factor in the lung with a dynamic pattern of expression and that FGF regulation of Elf5 by means of FGFR2b occurs through the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway.",

Akt, Singly Phosphorylated at Thr308, Remains Active and Functional in Response to Growth Factor Stimulation in SIN1-/- Cells Since Akt Thr308 phosphorylation was not dependent on Ser473 phosphorylation in SIN1-/- cells, we then asked whether this Thr308 singly phosphorylated Akt is still active and whether lack of Ser473 phosphorylation would have a global effect on the phosphorylation of Akt targets. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that Akt retained a substantial amount of enzymatic activity in SIN1-/- cells, although lower than that in wild-type cells (Figure 3B).

This results in inhibition of Akt activation (pAkt), which may be involved in the growth inhibitory responses seen with PPAR? activation. Decreased Akt activity also can lead to decreased activity of the transcription factor NF-?B. NF-?B is a critical transcription factor in the production of proangiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, IL-8. Decreased production of these factors would be expected to inhibit recruitment of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, and block tumor angiogenesis. PPAR?-mediated suppression of members of the Snail family of transcription factors, such as Snail, Zeb, or Twist, would lead to derepression of E-cadherin expression and promote the epithelial phenotype, leading to decreased migration and invasiveness. PPAR?-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression in NSCLC has been shown by several investigators. This would result in decreased PGE2 production, which will impact growth. TZDs can inhibit PGE2 production through a PPAR?-independent pathway involving induction of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). (Figure 2 full text)",

This leads to the autophosphorylation of Kit on tyrosine and its association with substrates of various kinds. The phophatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt system is one of the major pathways [33] (fig. 1). PI3K is composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. The 85-kDa regulatory subunit is associated with activated Kit through an SH2 domain, and then is phosphorylated on tyrosine. The 110-kDa catalytic subunit of the activated PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, which in turn is used for phosphorylation of Akt, a serine-threonine kinase. The activated Akt is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis of cells whose survival depends on Kit signaling. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate blocks not only autophosphorylation of Kit but also phosphorylation of Akt [34]. Induction of apoptosis in Kit signaling-dependent cells by imatinib mesylate may be mediated through the inhibition of Akt activity.",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

Thus PI3K, PDK, PKB and GSK3 constitute one important arm of the insulin signalling cascade regulating glycogen synthesis. In addition to inducing an increase in glucose transport, over-expression of PKB elicited an inhibition of GSK3 and a concomitant increase in glycogen and protein synthesis a decrease in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, glucose transport and membrane ruffling, which coincided with reduced phosphorylation of PKB and p70S6K but normal phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK observed an inhibition of PKB phosphorylation and downstream p70S6K activation, which was attributable to a PP2A-type phosphatase activity Akt phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3, decreasing the rate of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase",

For example, integrin- airlinked kinase (ILK) activation is inhibited by blockade of Akt function (Persad et al., 2000), and PTEN interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and influences cell migration (Tamura et al., 1999). These interactions affect cell survival, an event influenced by both VEGF and integrins. Also, cell migration and angiogenesis are reg- ulated by Akt and PTEN, and these cellular responses are clearly mediated by integrins (Jiang et al., 2000). By overexpression approaches, we have directly impli- cated Akt and PTEN in the pathway from VEGF to integ- rin activation. Thus, some of the functions of PI 3-kinase, Akt, and PTEN in cell migration may depend upon their role in integrin activation, and engagement of VEGFR2",

A regulatory link between p70s6k and PKB was demonstrated, as PDK1 was found to selectively phosphorylate p70s6k at Thr229. More importantly, PDK1 activated p70s6k in vitro and in vivo, whereas the catalytically inactive PDK1 blocked insulin-induced activation of p70s6k.",

              "summary_text": "Interestingly, the presence of two additional basic amino acids 6 and 7 residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation site in certain peptide substrates allows phosphorylation by CaMKI/IV equally well with or without activation by a CaMKK (14). This \\\"activation independence\\\" has not yet been demonstrated toward protein substrates. Nonetheless, because CaMKI/IV requires Ca2+/CaM for deinhibition in addition to activation loop phosphorylation, substrates of this type would not be phosphorylated by CaMKI/IV until a Ca2+ signal was initiated and so could represent Ca2+-dependent but activation-independent signaling targets. Subsequent activation by a CaMKK would increase the number of available substrates by enhancing CaMKI/IV activity toward a second set of substrates (Fig. 1).   Does the Cascade Function in Cells? TOP INTRODUCTION Identification and Biochemical... Does the Cascade Function... Is the Cascade Physiologic? Other Transcriptional Targets... Evidence for a CaMK... REFERENCES  The first reconstruction of a CaMK cascade in cells used transient transfection experiments with CREB as the transcriptional target. CaMKI and CaMKIV phosphorylate CREB on its activating Ser-133 in vitro and stimulate Gal4-CREB-dependent transcription in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ when cells are cotransfected with Gal4-CREB and a Gal4 reporter gene (15). Additional cotransfection with a CaMKK increases reporter activity more than 10-fold (8, 9). Mutation of the CaMKIV activation loop T to A abolishes CaMKK enhancement.  To be a signaling cascade, kinase activation loop phosphorylation must be dependent upon induction of CaMKK activity. Phosphate incorporation into endogenous CaMKIV in Jurkat cells is induced rapidly following T-cell receptor stimulation and is blocked by chelation of extracellular Ca2+. This is accompanied by 8-14-fold increases in immunoprecipitated CaMKIV activity that is refractory to further activation by exogenous CaMKK and can be reversed by in vitro treatment with PP2A (16). Recombinant CaMKIV transfected into BJAB cells, which lack endogenous CaMKIV, demonstrates similar activation following anti-IgM stimulation that is abrogated by mutating the activation loop T to A (4). Likewise, CaMKI phosphorylation is induced in PC12 cells, coincident with increased CaMKI activity and reduced activation of CaMKI by exogenous CaMKK (17). Collectively, these experiments provide strong evidence for an inducible, Ca2+-dependent activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV in intact cells via activation loop phosphorylation. However, the fact that activation loop phosphorylation requires Ca2+ does not confirm that the physiologic activator is itself Ca2+-dependent, because Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKI or CaMKIV is required before these enzymes can be phosphorylated by the known CaMKKs.  The issue of subcellular localization is a confounding one for any model of the CaMK cascade regulating transcription. There are several lines of evidence that CaMKK and - are both cytoplasmic. In contrast to an early study using a polyclonal antibody, immunohistochemistry of rat brain slices using monoclonal antibodies able to distinguish between the  and  isoforms found exclusively cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for both (18). Furthermore, green fluorescent protein-tagged CaMKK and - are cytoplasmic in NG108 cells even after depolarizing stimulation (18). This holds true for overexpressed CaMKK in Jurkat and BJAB cells.2 Similarly, CaMKI appears to be excluded from the nucleus in brain slices as well as in cells overexpressing the protein, yet CaMKI immunoreactivity has recently been observed to translocate to the nuclei of hippocampal neurons during long term potentiation (19, 20).3 In contrast, CaMKIV is predominantly nuclear but can also be found in neuronal soma and dendritic processes, where it could interact with a cytoplasmic CaMKK (21).  The CaMK cascade then is well positioned to affect cytoplasmic e...",

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

We observed that coexpression of oncogenic p21ras stimulated the transactivating activity of NF-IL6 and induced phosphorylation of Thr-235 located just N-terminal to the DNA binding domain of NF-IL6. Recently, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been shown to be implicated in the cellular response to activated ras. Purified MAP kinases specifically phosphorylated Thr-235 of NF-IL6 in vitro. Mutation of Thr-235 abolished the ras-dependent activation of NF-IL6. From these results, we conclude that NF-IL6 is regulated through phosphorylation by MAP kinases in response to activated ras.",

              "summary_text": "Also, antioxidants decrease the mRNA abundance of MSR-1 by suppressing NF-kB and decreasing MSR-1 mRNA stability rather than through direct effects on transcription [102]. A summary of redox effects on various transcription factors as well as on some elements of signal transduction pathways is presented in Table 1. Although Table 1 presents an overview of the effects as well as the differences that may occur between different cell models, a comprehensive presentation of all redox effects on these factors and their interactions is far beyond the scope of the present discussion. For more detailed discussions of some of the effects listed in Table 1, the reader is referred to several excellent reviews [14-17,93,103-105]. Also, we have primarily focused on oxygen-centered species rather than on reactive nitrogen species; for a review of nitrogen intermediates in signal transduction, the reader is referred to the article by Lander [90]. SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS Although many pathways are known to be redoxsensitive, none have been more thoroughly examined than the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways. Many of the redox effects on cells are mediated either directly or indirectly through these pathways, which contain multiple steps sensitive to ROS. Because of the large number of studies of oxidants on the various components of the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways, we provide a brief overview of both these pathways. MAP kinases Extracellular signaling molecules such as growth factors and cytokines induce changes in cell behavior via complex mechanisms that involve transmission of the signal from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, where gene expression is altered [303,304]. The first step of a signaling cascade usually involves the activation of receptors that either have protein kinase activity or activate protein kinases in the cytoplasm. The signal is eventually transmitted to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription factors that regulate gene expression. One of the most studied families of signal transduction pathways is the (MAP) kinase family (Fig. 1). Four MAP kinase subfamilies have been identified to date: (i) ERK [305- 309], (ii) JNK/SAP kinase [310-314], (iii) p38 kinases, [315-318], and (iv) big MAP kinase (BMK/ERK5) [319, 320]. All these pathways contain redox-sensitive sites (Table 1). In the ERK and JNK pathways, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor such as the mammalian homologue of Sos [321] activates Ras by conversion of Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP [322-324]. Sos must usually complex with other proteins to perform this function. It contains SH2 domains, which are a conserved sequence of 100 amino acids that bind to tyrosine phosphorylated motifs in other proteins [17]. In the cytoplasm, Sos is constitutively bound to another SH2 domain-containing protein, Grb-2 [325-327]. Activation of growth factor receptors results in tyrosine autophosphorylation and recruitment of SH2 domain-containing affectors, including Grb-2 [325,328-330]. The result is plasma membrane targeting of Sos [331], where it is tyrosinephosphorylated [332] (Fig. 1). The phosphorylated Grb-2/Sos complex binds to an adapter protein, the SH-containing (SHC) protein [330, 333-336], and the multiprotein complex activates Ras-GDP by converting it to its GTP-bound form [337]. Interestingly, treatment of cells with oxidants such as H2O2 stimulates formation of the SHC-Grb2-Sos complex [99].",

However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.",

              "summary_text": "We chose to analyze pancreatic cancer cells since this tumor type displays the highest frequency of somatic mutations of RAS genes of all human malignancies (5, 22). Hs766T cells express activated KRAS and display elevated levels of pERK1/2 and pAKT (Fig. 4C). Treatment of Hs766T cells with the PI3'-kinase inhibitor LY294002 led to a selective decrease in pAKT with little or no effect on pERK1/2. By contrast, treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or CI-1040 led to a selective decrease in pERK1/2 with little or no effect on pAKT. Strikingly, both the PI3'-kinase and the MEK inhibitors led to accumulation of p27Kip1 expression. These data are consistent with the observation that both MEK and PI3'-kinase inhibitors elicited a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in Hs766T cells (data not shown). Further consistent with these observations, treatment of a panel of pancreatic cancer cells (eight cell lines) (57) with a MEK inhibitor (U0126 or CI-1040) led to a consistent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest accompanied by induced expression of p27Kip1 in all eight cell lines tested (S. Gysin and M. McMahon, sub- mitted for publication). For the most part, treatment of cells with MEK inhibitors led to a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic effect, although cell death was often observed after prolonged treatment (+6 days). Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with LY294002 led in some cases to a cytostatic effect and in others to a more rapid cytotoxic effect. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 4C, inhibition of PI3'-kinase by LY294002 led to elevated p27Kip1 expression in five of eight pancreas cancer cell lines tested. These data are fully consistent with the hypothesis that the RAS-activated RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3'-kinase- PDK-AKT pathways play a role in the regulation of p27Kip1 expression in bona fide human cancer cell lines.",

Grb2 may bind Kit either directly or indirectly through interaction with Shc or SHP2. Since Grb2 is constitutively associated with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the recruitment of Grb2 to the activated Kit resultes in the colocalization of Sos and Ras and the subsequent activation of Ras. This promotes the interaction of Ras with Raf serinethreonine kinase and then the activation of MEK (a MAP kinase kinase). MEK phosphorylates ERK (a MAP kinase), and ERK phosphorylates a number of substrates, including pp90rsk [33]. Imatinib mesylate also inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK [34]. This process is considered to be due to blocking of the Kit signaling by this drug. Thus, both major signaling pathways of Kit, the PI3K/Akt system and the Ras/MAP kinase cascade, are inhibited by imatinib mesylate.",

Here, we discuss interconnecting signaling pathways controlled by RB and p53, attempting to explain their potentially universal involvement in the etiology of cancer.

              "summary_text": "Raf may also be activated by Ras-independent elements and, in turn, propagates signals through diverse effectors that mediate proliferation, angiogenesis, metastases, and survival.5 Raf may be activated by signaling upstream or constitutively. Constitutive activation of Raf and Ras are indistinguishable in their potential to induce malignant transformation.6-8 Activating raf mutations have been identified in melanoma, thyroid, colon, and other cancers (Table 1).9-43 Furthermore, the disappointing clinical results of farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitors (FTIs) that were developed based on a flawed premise that they would effectively target malignancies with a high incidence of Ras mutation has led to scrutiny of signaling elements downstream of Ras, such as Raf, as therapeutic targets.44 This review highlights relevant information about the biology of Raf and novel strategies directed at exploiting this knowledge to more effectively treat malignant diseases. SIGNALING THROUGH THE MAPK PATHWAY The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival are receiving considerable attention as potential targets for anticancer strategies. 45,46 Recently, there has been a notable increase in efforts directed at targeting the MAPK pathway, which integrates a wide array of proliferative signals initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein- coupled receptors.47,48 The network of signals emanating from the MAPK pathway are transmitted by proteins that serve as chemical switches, cycling between phosphorylated (activated) and dephosphorylated (inactivated) states.49 These on and off switches are regulated by kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Activated signaling elements, in turn, phosphorylate amino acid residues on downstream signaling proteins in a cascade-like and expansive manner.50 Not only does the centrality of the MAPK pathway render its components important targets for therapeutic development, but many genes that encode for its critical signaling elements undergo mutations, constitutively activating downstream signaling elements and conferring the potential for transformation and autonomous growth.50-52 In addition to efforts directed at Ras, therapeutic strategies directed at the MAPK pathway are targeting the cascade of downstream effector proteins including Raf, MAPK kinase (MAPKK; also called MEK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK] kinase), and ERK. The Raf/MEK/ERK module (Fig 1) of the MAPK pathway, which is immediately downstream of Ras, may be less redundant and innately resistant to therapeutic manipulations compared with Ras (as discussed in the next section). The Unfilled Promise of Targeting Ras The Raf/MEK/ERK module of the MAPK pathway has been the focus of considerable attention because therapeutic efforts directed at Ras, which is situated at the apex of the MAPK pathway, have been disappointing.44 Ras belongs to a superfamily of guanine nucleotide triphosphatases (GTPases) that transmit proliferative and survival signals to the MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and other pathways (Figs 1 and 2). Three ras proto-oncogenes encode four 21-kd proteins, called p21ras or Ras (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B, resulting from two alternatively spliced K-Ras gene products), that are localized to the inner surface of the cell membrane.44 Of the three ras genes, K-ras mutations are most commonly found in solid malignancies, whereas N-ras mutations are encountered less often, and H-ras mutations are rarely encountered.53,54 Ras isoforms impart distinct biologic effects as a result of the potential of these proteins to differentially activitate critical effectors.55 After synthesis as inactive cytosolic propeptides, Ras undergoes a series of post-translational modifications at its carboxyl terminus that increase its hydrophobicity.56,57 These modifications render Ras functional and capable of lo...",

The additive influence of three cis-acting elements is responsible for this regulation in an adrenal carcinoma cell line. Two sites, CRE2 at -48 base pairs (bp) relative to the start of transcription and CRE3 at +95 bp, are identical to the core motif of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) of the somatostatin gene and are conserved in the mouse, rat, and human ODC genes. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in a substantial decrease in basal promoter activity, as well as a 5-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter by PKA. CRE3 did not contribute to the basal activity of the ODC promoter, but mutation of this site resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility by PKA. Deletion of a 45-bp sequence (GC-box) located 5' of CRE2, also resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter. DNase I protection revealed the presence of protein binding at CRE2, the TATA box, and the GC-box of the ODC promoter. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in loss of protection of this sequence, as well as the 3' extension of the footprint over the TATA box, without affecting interactions at the GC box. Antibodies to the well characterized CRE-binding protein CREB recognized proteins binding to CRE2, suggesting that binding of CREB, or an antigenically related protein, is important for the activity of CRE2. Additionally, recombinant CREB bound to a DNA probe containing the CRE2 sequence.",

This regulation is mediated by direct activation of f-channels by cAMP (50, 128), which facilitates channel opening (126). DiFrancesco and Tortora (128) failed to observe a direct regulation of SAN f-channels by purified protein kinase A (PKA) (128). In SAN cells, direct regulation of voltage dependence by cAMP can quantitatively account for If regulation by autonomic agonists (126). The existence of a PKA-mediated regulation of If has been suggested by Chang et al. (80) in canine Purkinje cells and in murine stem cells derived from cardiomyocytes (1). Intracellular Ca2+ have been reported to positively regulate If by either increasing current conductance (171) or by positively shifting the current voltage dependence (416). The mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulate If has not been elucidated. Inside-out patch-clamp experiments seem to exclude a direct Ca2+ effect on f-channels (540).",

The activation of Ras also requires stimulation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, through its interaction with receptor substrates such as Gab-1 or IRS1/2. Activated ERK can translocate into the nucleus, where it catalyses the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as p62TCF, Blockade of the pathway with dominant negative mutants or pharmacological inhibitors prevents the stimulation of cell growth by insulin, but has no effect on the metabolic actions of the hormone54. Insulin increases synthesis and blocks the degradation of proteins through activation of mTOR. The stimulation of this protein kinase involves PI(3)K activation, although another signal may also be required56. mTOR can control the mammalian translation machinery by direct phosphorylation and activation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70rsk)57, as well as phosphorylation of the initiation factor 4E for eukaryotic translation (eIF-4E) inhibitor, PHAS1 or 4E-binding protein 1 (ref. 58). P70rsk activates ribosome biosynthesis by phosphorylating the ribosomal S6 protein, producing increased translation of mRNAs with a 58-terminal oligopyrimidine tract. P70rsk also requires a second PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent phosphorylation, presumably catalysed by PDK1. Phosphorylation of PHAS-1 by mTOR results in its dissociation from eIF-2, allowing capdependent translation of mRNAs with a highly structured 58-untranslated region. Although the mechanism of activation of mTOR remains unclear, it seems to require the presence of amino acids in the media for full activation by growth factors, and thus may also represent a nutrient sensor55. Glucose and lipid regulation Regulation of glycogen synthesis Insulin stimulates glycogen accumulation through a coordinated increase in glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. The hormone activates glycogen synthase by promoting its dephosphorylation, through the inhibition of kinases such as PKA or GSK-3 (ref. 59), and activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)60.",

High phosphorylation of PLB and RyRs generates periodical LCICR causing INCX-mediated membrane voltage oscillations, which contribute to the control of the chronotropic state of the cell (43, 508). .....Figure 23. In pacemaker cells, high basal cAMP-mediated PKA-dependent phosphorylation stimulates a perpetual \\\"free running\\\" Ca2+ cycling by pumping Ca2+ into the SR via SERCA2 and LCICR via RyRs. PKA also stimulates Ca2+ entry through Cav1.3-mediated ICa,L. The thick red line indicates the persistent spontaneous Ca2+ cycling. The possibility that Cav3.1-mediated ICa,T can contribute to replenishment of SR Ca2+ stores is suggested. Spontaneous LCICR from SR is linked to the diastolic depolarization via Ca2+ activation of inward INCX current. Direct cAMP-dependent activation of HCN channels or cAMP-mediated, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Cav1.3 channels and Ist (dashed lines) strongly stimulates the pacemaker cycle driven by the \\\"membrane ion channels clock\\\" (MCC). It is conceivable that the MCC can entrain the intracellular Ca2+ clock because of the dependency of SR Ca2+ content from VDCCs. (see Fig 23 for detail)",

              "summary_text": "Insulin is the most-potent physiological anabolic agent known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates and lipids and inhibiting their degradation and release into the circulation. This action of the hormone is due in part to the acute regulation of metabolic enzymes through changes in their phosphorylation state. In fat, liver, and muscle, insulin stimulates the dephosphorylation of a number of enzymes involved in glycogen and lipid metabolism via activation of protein phosphatases. Numerous studies have indicated that protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is the primary phosphatase involved in insulin action. Although PP1 is a cytosolic protein, the phosphatase is compartmentalized in cells by discrete targeting subunits. These proteins confer substrate specificity to PP1 and mediate the specific regulation of intracellular pools of PP1 by a variety of extracellular signals. Four proteins have been described that target the phosphatase to the glycogen particle. G(M) and GL are expressed exclusively in striated muscle and liver, while protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) and R6 are more widely expressed. Despite a common targeting function, these four proteins are not highly conserved, suggesting profound differences in the mechanisms by which they contribute to the hormonal regulation of PP1 activity. Overexpression studies in cell lines or animals have revealed major differences among these proteins regarding basal glycogen levels and hormonal responsiveness. Furthermore, alterations in the expression or function of PP1 glycogen-targeting subunits may contribute to the onset of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

Furthermore, mutation of CRE abolishes SREBP-dependent activation after overexpression of SREBP-1a and CRE binding protein (CREB). This shows that CRE is essential, and that under ex vivo conditions CREB and SREBP cooperate in transactivating CYP51. Interestingly, protein kinase A shows a marked stimulation of the CYP51 promoter activity when overexpressed together with SREBP-1a but not when overexpressed with CREB, suggesting phosphorylation of SREBP-1a. Using a DNA probe containing all three regulatory elements, it is found that SREBP-1a, a CREB-like factor, and specificity protein (Sp1) all probably bind the CYP51 promoter. While SREBP-1a and the CRE-bound proteins are essential for the SREBP-dependent response, Sp1 apparently functions only to maximize sterol regulation of CYP51.",
