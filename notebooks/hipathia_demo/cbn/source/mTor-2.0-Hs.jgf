If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

              "summary_text": "Involvement of Rheb in the insulin TOR S6K signaling pathway was further investigated in mammalian cells. Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

Activated PKB/Akt further activates mTOR through inhibiting a downstream protein complex, the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2, that represses the small G protein Rheb, causing inhibition of autophagy.",

Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a potentially devastating disease associated with mutations in two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and 2, that function as a complex to suppress signaling in the mTOR/S6K/4E-BP pathway. However, the inhibitory target of TSC1/2 and the mechanism by which it acts are unknown. Here we provide evidence that TSC1/2 is a GAP for the small GTPase Rheb and that insulin-mediated Rheb activation is PI3K dependent. Moreover, Rheb overexpression induces S6K1 phosphorylation and inhibits PKB phosphorylation, as do loss-of-function mutations in TSC1/2, but contrary to earlier reports Rheb has no effect on MAPK phosphorylation. Finally, coexpression of a human TSC2 cDNA harboring a disease-associated point mutation in the GAP domain, failed to stimulate Rheb GTPase activity or block Rheb activation of S6K1.",

Instead of signalling through Akt, recent studies suggested that amino acids may indirectly modulate mTOR-dependent signalling through TSC1-TSC2, GbL-raptor and/or Rheb. For example, repressed expression of TSC2 (Gao et al. 2002) yields cells that are resistant to the effects of amino acid deprivation on signalling events downstream of mTOR.",

Activated PKB/Akt further activates mTOR through inhibiting a downstream protein complex, the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2, that represses the small G protein Rheb, causing inhibition of autophagy.",

Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

In addition to stimulating p70S6 kinase-mediated protein translation, activation of mTOR inhibits PHAS1 (phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein 1) (also known as 4E-BP), which is a negative regulator of the translation initiation factor eIF-4E [59]. It has recently been shown that PHAS-1 can directly bind a protein called Raptor, which also binds mTOR [60,61] (Fig. 1). Mutations in PHAS-1 that inhibit interaction with Raptor also inhibit mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of PHAS-1 [62]. Finally, overexpression of Raptor can enhance the phosphorylation of PHAS-1 by mTOR in vitro [62,63]. mTOR binds PHAS-1 by a TOR signaling (TOS) motif; this same motif is found in p70S6K [63].",

Peptides which correspond in sequence to this domain inhibit the kinase [51], consistent with the hypothesis that Module IV acts as an autoinhibitory domain. These four residues are hypophosphorylated in quiescent cells, and become hyperphosphorylated in response to serum [23]. Substitution of these S/T-P sites with alanines [23] suppresses activation of the kinase, whilst the corresponding acidic residue replacements raise basal kinase activity [10]. ",

The 4E-BPs are dephosphoryled as a consequence of rapamycin treatment.  Binding of 4E-BP1 (the best studied 4E-BP family member) to eIF4E is regulated by its phosphorylation status: the hypophosphorylated form (residues Thr37 and 46) of 4E-BP1 binds very tightly to eIF4E and inhibits cap-dependent translation.",

Activated PKB/Akt further activates mTOR through inhibiting a downstream protein complex, the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2, that represses the small G protein Rheb, causing inhibition of autophagy.",

Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

VEGF mRNA expression was elevated in tumours expressing the epidermal growth factor receptor These data suggest that elevated VEGF protein expression, by both enhanced transcription and translation, is a potential means by which tumour angiogenesis is induced in breast carcinomas.

It has recently been shown that PHAS-1 can directly bind a protein called Raptor, which also binds mTOR [60,61] (Fig. 1). Mutations in PHAS-1 that inhibit interaction with Raptor also inhibit mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of PHAS-1 [62]. Finally, overexpression of Raptor can enhance the phosphorylation of PHAS-1 by mTOR in vitro [62,63]. mTOR binds PHAS-1 by a TOR signaling (TOS) motif; this same motif is found in p70S6K [63].",

Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

More importantly, in the presence of rapamycin and FKBP12, but not in the presence of either component alone, phosphorylation of Ser371 by mTOR is abolished (Fig. 5A), consistent with the in vivo finding (Fig. 4). In parallel, incubation of S6K1-E389D3E with HA-mTOR-WT also led to increased S6K1-E389D3E activation and Ser371 phosphorylation, in an FKBP-12/rapamycin-sensitive manner (Fig. 5B and data not shown). Furthermore, the extent of both responses was similar to those observed in vivo (compare Figs. 4B and 5B). Therefore, Ser371 phosphorylation appears to be directly regulated by mTOR in vitro and in vivo. (From full text)   Incubation of either S6 kinase variant with wild type, but not kinase-inactive, mTOR led to increased Thr389 phosphorylation, with the extent of Thr389 phosphorylation much higher in S6K1-S371A than in wild type S6K1 (Fig. 6B). However, to achieve the same level of activity as S6K1-WT, S6K1-S371A apparently requires much higher levels of Thr389 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B), consistent with detailed titration studies (data not shown). Although unexpected, these findings are compatible with Ser371 phosphorylation regulating Thr389 phosphorylation and with its ability to directly affect S6K1 activity. (From full text)",

Activated PKB/Akt further activates mTOR through inhibiting a downstream protein complex, the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2, that represses the small G protein Rheb, causing inhibition of autophagy.",

The identification of N-myc target genes is an important step for understanding N-Myc biological functions in both physiological and pathological contexts. In this study, we describe the identification of N-Myc-responsive genes through chromatin immunoprecipitation and methylation-sensitive restriction analysis. Results show that N-Myc is a direct regulator of several identified genes, and that methylation of the CpG dinucleotide within the E-box prevents the access of N-Myc to gene promoters in vivo. Furthermore, methylation profile of the E-box within the promoters of EGFR and CASP8, two genes directly controlled by Myc, is cell type-specific, suggesting that differential E-box methylation may contribute to generating unique patterns of Myc-dependent transcription. This study illuminates a central role of DNA methylation in controlling N-Myc occupancy at gene promoters and modulating its transcriptional activity in cancer cells.",

These findings were correlated with decreased expression of genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 3gamma, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and retinoid X receptor.% These results indicate that c- myc overexpression may counteract diabetic changes by controlling hepatic glucose metabolism, both directly by altering the expression of metabolic genes and through the expression of key transcription factor genes.",

When bound to DNA by a LexA moiety in yeast, Mxi1 does not stimulate transcription. mxi1 mRNA is expressed in many tissues, and its expression is elevated in U-937 myeloid leukemia cells that have been stimulated to differentiate. These facts are consistent with a model in which Mxi1-Max heterodimers indirectly inhibit Myc function in two ways: first, by sequestering Max, thus preventing the formation of Myc-Max heterodimers, and second, by competing with Myc-Max heterodimers for binding to target sites.",

MYC is a member of the MYC/MAX/MAD network of the basic region/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLHZ) domain transcriptional regulators (for a summary of the domain structure see Fig. 1). MYC proteins form obligatory heterodimers with MAX, and these complexes bind to specific E-box DNA sequences with the consensus 5beta-CACGTG (7). The transactivation domain (TAD) is localized at theNterminus, containing two highly conserved elements, Myc box (MB) I and II, that are particularly relevant for MYC regulation and cofactor recruitment, respectively (Fig. 1). Within the MYC/MAX/MAD network, MYC proteins are antagonized by several bHLHZ proteins collectively referred to as MAD proteins (for an overview of the network see Fig. S2A) (8).",

These results indicate that the degradation of p27 is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: translocation-coupled cytoplasmic ubiquitylation by KPC at the G0 G1 transition and nuclear ubiquitylation by SKP2 during S and G2 phases (see Supplementary information S2 (figure)). Given that, in a subset of breast cancers (32 out of 84 samples)45, p27 levels were low despite SKP2 not being expressed, it remains possible that the expression of KPC might be elevated in such cases. Surprisingly, SKP2 also binds to MYC through its MB2 and helix loop helix leucine zipper (HLHZip) domains, and thereby mediates its ubiquitylation and degradation. However, SKP2 unexpectedly increases the transactivation activity of MYC, indicating that SKP2 is a transcriptional cofactor. Consistent with this notion, MYC accumulates, but its transcriptional activity is reduced, in mouse Skp2 ko cells.",

The changes in gene expression are consistent with the ChIP results and indicate that cyclin E/Cdk2 enhances, whereas IFN-?, through the activation of p27, represses Myc-activated transcription (and vice versa for Myc-repressed transcription) of genes involved in cellular senescence.

We now show that Myc is bound to the cyclin D2 promoter in vivo. Binding of Myc induces cyclin D2 expression and histone acetylation at a single nucleosome in a MycBoxII/TRRAP-dependent manner. Down-regulation of cyclin D2 mRNA expression in differentiating HL60 cells is preceded by a switch of promoter occupancy from Myc/Max to Mad/Max complexes, loss of TRRAP binding, increased HDAC1 binding, and histone deacetylation. Thus, recruitment of TRRAP and regulation of histone acetylation are critical for transcriptional activation by Myc.",

The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors.

Binding of TGF-? to its type II receptor in concert with the type I receptor (A) leads to formation of a receptor complex and phosphorylation of the type I receptor. The type I receptor subsequently phosphorylates Smad2 or 3 (B), allowing this complex to associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus (C). In the nucleus, the Smad complex associates with a transcription factor and this complex binds to specific enhancers in target genes (down-) regulating transcription (D). TNF is able to interfere with TGF-? signaling through the upregulation of the inhibitory Smad7 protein (E). Smad7 is capable of inhibiting the Smad2 and 3 phosphorylating process by competing with the receptor interaction but Smad7 also can dephosphorylate the complex. In addition, Smad7 itself is capable to upregulate TGF? gene expression. As described in the discussion, CSE is most likely capable to interfere with the Smad pathway although this is not yet fully elucidated. (F). Phosphorylated Smad3 is able to stimulate the transcription of the decorin gene (G).",

Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a potentially devastating disease associated with mutations in two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 and 2, that function as a complex to suppress signaling in the mTOR/S6K/4E-BP pathway. However, the inhibitory target of TSC1/2 and the mechanism by which it acts are unknown. Here we provide evidence that TSC1/2 is a GAP for the small GTPase Rheb and that insulin-mediated Rheb activation is PI3K dependent. Moreover, Rheb overexpression induces S6K1 phosphorylation and inhibits PKB phosphorylation, as do loss-of-function mutations in TSC1/2, but contrary to earlier reports Rheb has no effect on MAPK phosphorylation. Finally, coexpression of a human TSC2 cDNA harboring a disease-associated point mutation in the GAP domain, failed to stimulate Rheb GTPase activity or block Rheb activation of S6K1.",

This results in inhibition of Akt activation (pAkt), which may be involved in the growth inhibitory responses seen with PPAR? activation. Decreased Akt activity also can lead to decreased activity of the transcription factor NF-?B. NF-?B is a critical transcription factor in the production of proangiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, IL-8. Decreased production of these factors would be expected to inhibit recruitment of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, and block tumor angiogenesis. PPAR?-mediated suppression of members of the Snail family of transcription factors, such as Snail, Zeb, or Twist, would lead to derepression of E-cadherin expression and promote the epithelial phenotype, leading to decreased migration and invasiveness. PPAR?-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression in NSCLC has been shown by several investigators. This would result in decreased PGE2 production, which will impact growth.

To further define the pathways by which FGFs activate Elf5 expression, we cultured E11.5 lung tips in the presence of compounds to inhibit FGF receptors (SU5402), PI3-Kinase/Akt-mediated signaling (LY294002), and MAP Kinase/Erk-mediated signaling (U0126). We found that SU5402 and LY294002 significantly reduced Elf5 expression, whereas U0126 had no effect. LY294002 also reduced Elf5 expression in cultures of purified epithelium. Finally, pAkt was coexpressed with Elf5 in the proximal epithelial airways of E17.5 lungs. These results demonstrate that Elf5 is an FGF-sensitive transcription factor in the lung with a dynamic pattern of expression and that FGF regulation of Elf5 by means of FGFR2b occurs through the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway.",

Because FAK binds PI 3-kinase, the protective effect against anoikis may be the result of PI 3-kinase-mediated activation of protein kinase B/Akt (52). Akt promotes survival, at least in part, by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating two proapoptotic proteins, Bad and caspase-9 (53) (Fig. 4). Inhibition of p53 prevents FAKdeficient cells from undergoing anoikis when deprived of growth factors, suggesting that p53 mediates the death signal under FAK deficiency (51).",

This leads to the autophosphorylation of Kit on tyrosine and its association with substrates of various kinds. The phophatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt system is one of the major pathways [33] (fig. 1). PI3K is composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. The 85-kDa regulatory subunit is associated with activated Kit through an SH2 domain, and then is phosphorylated on tyrosine. The 110-kDa catalytic subunit of the activated PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, which in turn is used for phosphorylation of Akt, a serine-threonine kinase. The activated Akt is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis of cells whose survival depends on Kit signaling. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate blocks not only autophosphorylation of Kit but also phosphorylation of Akt [34]. Induction of apoptosis in Kit signaling-dependent cells by imatinib mesylate may be mediated through the inhibition of Akt activity.",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

For example, integrin- airlinked kinase (ILK) activation is inhibited by blockade of Akt function (Persad et al., 2000), and PTEN interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and influences cell migration (Tamura et al., 1999). These interactions affect cell survival, an event influenced by both VEGF and integrins. Also, cell migration and angiogenesis are reg- ulated by Akt and PTEN, and these cellular responses are clearly mediated by integrins (Jiang et al., 2000). By overexpression approaches, we have directly impli- cated Akt and PTEN in the pathway from VEGF to integ- rin activation. Thus, some of the functions of PI 3-kinase, Akt, and PTEN in cell migration may depend upon their role in integrin activation, and engagement of VEGFR2",

              "summary_text": "Interestingly, the presence of two additional basic amino acids 6 and 7 residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation site in certain peptide substrates allows phosphorylation by CaMKI/IV equally well with or without activation by a CaMKK (14). This \\\"activation independence\\\" has not yet been demonstrated toward protein substrates. Nonetheless, because CaMKI/IV requires Ca2+/CaM for deinhibition in addition to activation loop phosphorylation, substrates of this type would not be phosphorylated by CaMKI/IV until a Ca2+ signal was initiated and so could represent Ca2+-dependent but activation-independent signaling targets. Subsequent activation by a CaMKK would increase the number of available substrates by enhancing CaMKI/IV activity toward a second set of substrates (Fig. 1).   Does the Cascade Function in Cells? TOP INTRODUCTION Identification and Biochemical... Does the Cascade Function... Is the Cascade Physiologic? Other Transcriptional Targets... Evidence for a CaMK... REFERENCES  The first reconstruction of a CaMK cascade in cells used transient transfection experiments with CREB as the transcriptional target. CaMKI and CaMKIV phosphorylate CREB on its activating Ser-133 in vitro and stimulate Gal4-CREB-dependent transcription in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ when cells are cotransfected with Gal4-CREB and a Gal4 reporter gene (15). Additional cotransfection with a CaMKK increases reporter activity more than 10-fold (8, 9). Mutation of the CaMKIV activation loop T to A abolishes CaMKK enhancement.  To be a signaling cascade, kinase activation loop phosphorylation must be dependent upon induction of CaMKK activity. Phosphate incorporation into endogenous CaMKIV in Jurkat cells is induced rapidly following T-cell receptor stimulation and is blocked by chelation of extracellular Ca2+. This is accompanied by 8-14-fold increases in immunoprecipitated CaMKIV activity that is refractory to further activation by exogenous CaMKK and can be reversed by in vitro treatment with PP2A (16). Recombinant CaMKIV transfected into BJAB cells, which lack endogenous CaMKIV, demonstrates similar activation following anti-IgM stimulation that is abrogated by mutating the activation loop T to A (4). Likewise, CaMKI phosphorylation is induced in PC12 cells, coincident with increased CaMKI activity and reduced activation of CaMKI by exogenous CaMKK (17). Collectively, these experiments provide strong evidence for an inducible, Ca2+-dependent activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV in intact cells via activation loop phosphorylation. However, the fact that activation loop phosphorylation requires Ca2+ does not confirm that the physiologic activator is itself Ca2+-dependent, because Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKI or CaMKIV is required before these enzymes can be phosphorylated by the known CaMKKs.  The issue of subcellular localization is a confounding one for any model of the CaMK cascade regulating transcription. There are several lines of evidence that CaMKK and - are both cytoplasmic. In contrast to an early study using a polyclonal antibody, immunohistochemistry of rat brain slices using monoclonal antibodies able to distinguish between the  and  isoforms found exclusively cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for both (18). Furthermore, green fluorescent protein-tagged CaMKK and - are cytoplasmic in NG108 cells even after depolarizing stimulation (18). This holds true for overexpressed CaMKK in Jurkat and BJAB cells.2 Similarly, CaMKI appears to be excluded from the nucleus in brain slices as well as in cells overexpressing the protein, yet CaMKI immunoreactivity has recently been observed to translocate to the nuclei of hippocampal neurons during long term potentiation (19, 20).3 In contrast, CaMKIV is predominantly nuclear but can also be found in neuronal soma and dendritic processes, where it could interact with a cytoplasmic CaMKK (21).  The CaMK cascade then is well positioned to affect cytoplasmic e...",

We found that although Ser473 phosphorylation was completely abolished in the SIN1-/- cells, Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt was not blocked (Figure 3A). These results indicate that SIN1 is not essential for Akt Thr308 phosphorylation and that the Ser473 phosphorylation is not a prerequisite for Thr308 phosphorylation. Akt, Singly Phosphorylated at Thr308, Remains Active and Functional in Response to Growth Factor Stimulation in SIN1-/- Cells Since Akt Thr308 phosphorylation was not dependent on Ser473 phosphorylation in SIN1-/- cells, we then asked whether this Thr308 singly phosphorylated Akt is still active and whether lack of Ser473 phosphorylation would have a global effect on the phosphorylation of Akt targets. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that Akt retained a substantial amount of enzymatic activity in SIN1-/- cells, although lower than that in wild-type cells (Figure 3B). Thus, singly phosphorylated (Thr308) Akt is an active but weaker enzyme.",

Data from some experimental models suggest that this might represent a mechanism by which signaling is terminated, or perhaps attenuated in states of insulin resistance. Numerous in vitro studies have shown that the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor decreases as a consequence of serine/threonine phosphorylation. This might occur via  feedback \\\"retrophosphorylation\\\" events in which the receptor or IRS proteins are serine phosphorylated by GSK3 or mTOR, both of which are activated downstream of IRS phosphorylation.",

The restructured/ ordered aC helix was implied to set the substrate specificity of Akt (Yang et al., 2002a). Despite being widely used as a key indicator of Akt activation, the precise physiological function of Ser473 phosphorylation site remains to be fully understood. The kinase that phosphorylates the HMsite of Akt, often referred to as PDK2, has been controversial. Various kinases have been proposed to act as the PDK2 for Akt, including ILK, DNA-PK, and PKC (Bayascas and Alessi, 2005; Dong and Liu, 2005; Feng et al., 2004; Kawakami et al., 2004; Troussard et al., 2003; Woodgett, 2005). However, despite a lack of genetic evidence, recent biochemical studies have strongly suggested that TORC2 is the elusive PDK2 for Akt Ser473 (Hresko and Mueckler, 2005; Sarbassov et al., 2005b).",

Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

However, the mechanism by which Akt activates mTOR is not fully understood. The known pathway by which Akt activates mTOR is via direct phosphorylation and inhibition of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), which is a negative regulator of mTOR. Here we establish an additional pathway by which Akt inhibits TSC2 and activates mTOR. We provide for the first time genetic evidence that Akt regulates intracellular ATP level and demonstrate that Akt is a negative regulator of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is an activator of TSC2. We show that in Akt1/Akt2 DKO cells AMP/ATP ratio is markedly elevated with concomitant increase in AMPK activity, whereas in cells expressing activated Akt there is a dramatic decrease in AMP/ATP ratio and a decline in AMPK activity. Currently, the Akt-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 and the inhibition of AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 are viewed as two separate pathways, which activate mTOR. Our results demonstrate that Akt lies upstream of these two pathways and induces full inhibition of TSC2 and activation of mTOR both through direct phosphorylation and by inhibition of AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2. We propose that the activation of mTOR by Akt-mediated cellular energy and inhibition of AMPK is the predominant pathway by which Akt activates mTOR in vivo.",
