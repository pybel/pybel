If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

Relative differences in gene expression between TMX-induced and noninduced HOXB4ER samples were calculated by using the 2-DDCT method by normalizing the CT values for each gene to the CT values of the housekeeping gene, actin. Values are shown as fold induction (mean ± SD) in the absence (green bars) and presence of CHX (red bars). ** indicates direct gene targets of HOXB4, displaying differential gene expression in the presence of CHX.",

              "summary_text": "Integrin-mediated cell attachment and growth factor stimulation often act synergistically on cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. Some of these synergistic effects depend on the physical interaction of integrins with growth factor receptors. Here we examine the nature of the physical interaction between the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGF-Rbeta) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2, also known as KDR and flk-1). Both of these RTKs associate with the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin but do not associate with beta(1) integrins. Furthermore, growth factor stimulation of these RTKs promotes increased cell proliferation and migration when cells are attached to the alpha(v)beta(3) ligand, vitronectin. We show that alpha(v)beta(3) in which the beta(3) cytoplasmic domain is deleted or replaced with the beta(1) cytoplasmic domain coimmunoprecipitates with PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2. The beta(3) extracellular domain alone was sufficient for the PDGF-Rbeta association whereas the VEGF-R2 association required the presence of the alpha(v) subunit. Activation of the RTKs by their ligands was not required for them to associate with the integrin. Cell migration to PDGF was enhanced in the cells transfected with the chimeric subunit containing the beta(3) extracellular domain but not when that domain came from the beta(1) subunit. These results show that the interactions that lead to the association of the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin with PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2 and enhancement of RTK activity take place outside the cell.",

We have localized the alpha(v)beta(3) binding sites in gammaC using gammaC-derived synthetic peptides. We found that two peptides GWTVFQKRLDGSV(190-202) and GVYYQGGTYSKAS(346-358) block the alpha(v)beta(3) binding to gammaC or alpha(E)C, block the alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated clot retraction, and induce the ligand-induced binding site 2 (LIBS2) epitope in alpha(v)beta(3). Neither peptide affects fibrinogen binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3). Scrambled or inverted peptides were not effective. These results suggest that the two gammaC-derived peptides directly interact with alpha(v)beta(3) and specifically block alpha(v)beta(3)-gammaC or alpha(E)C interaction. The two sequences are located next to each other in the gammaC crystal structure, although they are separate in the primary structure. Asp-199, Ser-201, Gln-350, Thr-353, Lys-356, Ala-357, and Ser-358 residues are exposed to the surface. This suggests that the two sequences are part of alpha(v)beta(3) binding sites in fibrinogen gammaC domain. We also found that tenascin C C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain specifically binds to alpha(v)beta(3). Notably, a peptide WYRNCHRVNLMGRYGDNNHSQGVNWFHWKG from this domain that includes the sequence corresponding to gammaC GVYYQGGTYSKAS(346-358) specifically binds to alpha(v)beta(3), suggesting that fibrinogen and tenascin C C-terminal domains interact with alpha(v)beta(3) in a similar manner.",

TNF-a is angiogenic in part via its action on integrin avb3 (34). Thus, we examined whether blocking avb3 would inhibit IL-18-induced angiogenesis in the HMVEC migration assay. HMVECs were first incubated with anti-avb3 Ab or nonspecific control IgG at 25 mg/ml for 1 h before and during the chemotaxis assay. IL-18 (10 nM) was then used to stimulate HMVEC migration, and comparison was made with the control stimulants bFGF and TNF-a. To illustrate a contrasting mechanism, VEGF was also used as another stimulant, which would not be expected to be inhibited by blocking avb3, since the angiogenic ability of VEGF is thought to occur via the integrin avb5 (42). Blocking HMVEC avb3 resulted in significant inhibition of IL-18-induced cell migration comparable with that seen with control (Fig. 6). The same effect was seen with 25 or 10 mg/ml blocking Ab concentration. Significant inhibition of cell migration by blocking HMVEC avb3 before stimulation with bFGF and TNF-a was also demonstrated, while no change in cell migration occurred after stimulation with VEGF. Shown are the representative data from three separate assays.",

              "summary_text": "BACKGROUND: Bone sialoprotein (BSP) interacts separately with both matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and integrin alpha(v)beta3 and is overexpressed in many metastatic tumors. Its role in tumor biology, however, remains unclear. We investigated whether BSP enhances cancer cell invasiveness by forming a trimolecular complex with MMP-2 and cell-surface integrin alpha(v)beta3. METHODS: Invasiveness of breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid tumor cell lines was measured with a modified Boyden chamber assay. Binding and co-localization of BSP, MMP-2, and integrin alpha(v)beta3 were investigated with immunoprecipitation and in situ hybridization. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Treatment with BSP increased invasiveness of many breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid cancer cells through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner. BSP at 50 nM increased the invasiveness of SW-579 thyroid cancer cells (95.2 units, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 90.4 to 100 units) by approximately 10-fold compared with that of untreated control SW-579 cells (9.1 units, 95% CI = 5.7 to 12.5 units) (P<.001). Addition of an inactive mutated BSP, in which BSP's integrin-binding RGD tripeptide was altered, or addition of integrin alpha(v)beta3-blocking antibodies resulted in invasiveness equivalent to that of untreated cells. Inhibiting cellular MMP-2 activity with chemical inhibitors or a specific antibody also blocked BSP-enhanced invasiveness. Osteopontin and dentin matrix protein 1, proteins related to BSP that also bind integrin alpha(v)beta3 and form complexes with other MMPs (but not MMP-2), did not enhance invasiveness. Immunoprecipitation showed that a complex containing BSP, integrin alpha(v)beta3, and MMP-2 formed in vitro. Addition of BSP increased the amount of MMP-2 bound by cells in an integrin-dependent fashion. Co-expression of BSP, integrin alpha(v)beta3, and MMP-2 in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells was shown by in situ hybridization. CONCLUSION: Cancer cells appear to become more invasive when BSP forms a cell-surface trimolecular complex by linking MMP-2 to integrin alpha(v)beta3.",

CD44v6 is a splice variant of CD44 which has been identified as a marker of cancer progression. In this study, immortalized liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) were used to examine the effect of OPN on two isoforms of CD44: CD44 standard (CD44 s) and CD44v6. Western blots demonstrated that OPN up-regulated plasma membrane CD44v6 protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. CD44v6 levels returned to control levels when OPN-alphavbeta3-integrin binding was blocked by an RGD peptide or tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited. OPN significantly increased CD44v6 protein synthesis, while simultaneously decreasing protein degradation. Steady-state mRNA levels of both CD44s and CD44v6 were unaltered in the presence of OPN stimulation. OPN increased HepG2 in vitro adhesion to hyaluronate (HA); excess soluble HA extinguished OPN-mediated HepG2 adhesion, indicating CD44 dependence. In conclusion, OPN binds to the alphavbeta3-integrin to increase plasma membrane CD44v6 expression and augment in vitro adhesion to HA. This may contribute to the mechanism by which OPN enhances metastatic behavior in hepatocellular cancer cells.",

              "summary_text": "Metastatic cancer cells, like trophoblasts of the developing placenta, are invasive and must escape immune surveillance to survive. Complement has long been thought to play a significant role in the tumor surveillance mechanism. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN, ETA-1) are expressed by trophoblasts and are strongly up-regulated by many tumors. Indeed, BSP has been shown to be a positive indicator of the invasive potential of some tumors. In this report, we show that BSP and OPN form rapid and tight complexes with complement Factor H. Besides its key role in regulating complement-mediated cell lysis, Factor H also appears to play a role when hijacked by invading organisms in enabling cellular evasion of complement. We have investigated whether BSP and OPN may play a similar role in tumor cell complement evasion by testing to see whether these glycoproteins could promote tumor cell survival. Recombinant OPN and BSP can protect murine erythroleukemia cells from attack by human complement as well as human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and U-266 myeloma cells from attack by guinea pig complement. The mechanism of this gain of function by tumor cell expression of BSP or OPN has been defined using specific peptides and antibodies to block BSP and OPN protective activity. The expression of BSP and OPN in tumor cells provides a selective advantage for survival via initial binding to alpha(V)beta(3) integrin (both) or CD44 (OPN) on the cell surface, followed by sequestration of Factor H to the cell surface and inhibition of complement-mediated cell lysis.",

We describe here a novel pathway that modulates cell migration and that is activated by alphavbeta3 and, as downstream effector, by cdc2 (cdk1). We report that alphavbeta3 expression in LNCaP (beta3-LNCaP) prostate cancer cells causes increased cdc2 mRNA levels as evaluated by gene expression analysis, and increased cdc2 protein and kinase activity levels. We provide three lines of evidence that increased levels of cdc2 contribute to a motile phenotype on integrin ligands in different cell types. First, increased levels of cdc2 correlate with more motile phenotypes of cancer cells. Second, ectopic expression of cdc2 increases cell migration, whereas expression of dominant-negative cdc2 inhibits migration. Third, cdc2 inhibitors reduce cell migration without affecting cell adhesion. We also show that cdc2 increases cell migration via specific association with cyclin B2, and we unravel a novel pathway of cell motility that involves, downstream of cdc2, caldesmon. cdc2 and caldesmon are shown here to localize in membrane ruffles in motile cells. These results show that cdc2 is a downstream effector of the alphavbeta3 integrin, and that it promotes cell migration.",

TNF-a is angiogenic in part via its action on integrin avb3 (34). Thus, we examined whether blocking avb3 would inhibit IL-18-induced angiogenesis in the HMVEC migration assay. HMVECs were first incubated with anti-avb3 Ab or nonspecific control IgG at 25 mg/ml for 1 h before and during the chemotaxis assay. IL-18 (10 nM) was then used to stimulate HMVEC migration, and comparison was made with the control stimulants bFGF and TNF-a. To illustrate a contrasting mechanism, VEGF was also used as another stimulant, which would not be expected to be inhibited by blocking avb3, since the angiogenic ability of VEGF is thought to occur via the integrin avb5 (42). Blocking HMVEC avb3 resulted in significant inhibition of IL-18-induced cell migration comparable with that seen with control (Fig. 6). The same effect was seen with 25 or 10 mg/ml blocking Ab concentration. Significant inhibition of cell migration by blocking HMVEC avb3 before stimulation with bFGF and TNF-a was also demonstrated, while no change in cell migration occurred after stimulation with VEGF. Shown are the representative data from three separate assays.",

This multistep process requires extensive signaling through growth factor receptors and integrins. Among the integrins involved in this process, integrin alphavbeta3 is specific to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced angiogenesis. Here we show that junctional adhesion molecule 1/A (JAM-1/A) and alphavbeta3 form a complex in the absence of bFGF. JAM-1, which is normally localized at the cell-cell junctions of quiescent endothelial cells, redistributes to the cell surface on bFGF treatment. Blockage of the extracellular domain of JAM-1 inhibits bFGF-induced endothelial cell morphology, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Additionally, mutation in the JAM-1 cytoplasmic domain blocks bFGF-induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and ablates its ability to induce endothelial cell tube formation, suggesting that signaling through JAM-1 is key to bFGF-induced signaling. Immunoprecipitation analysis suggests that bFGF signaling dissociates the JAM-1/ alphavbeta3 complex, allowing for signaling through JAM-1 and alphavbeta3. In addition, blockage of either JAM-1 or alphavbeta3 inhibits bFGF-induced MAP kinase activation. Thus, our results suggest that signaling through JAM-1 and alphavbeta3 is necessary for bFGF-induced angiogenesis.",

TNF-a is angiogenic in part via its action on integrin avb3 (34). Thus, we examined whether blocking avb3 would inhibit IL-18-induced angiogenesis in the HMVEC migration assay. HMVECs were first incubated with anti-avb3 Ab or nonspecific control IgG at 25 mg/ml for 1 h before and during the chemotaxis assay. IL-18 (10 nM) was then used to stimulate HMVEC migration, and comparison was made with the control stimulants bFGF and TNF-a. To illustrate a contrasting mechanism, VEGF was also used as another stimulant, which would not be expected to be inhibited by blocking avb3, since the angiogenic ability of VEGF is thought to occur via the integrin avb5 (42). Blocking HMVEC avb3 resulted in significant inhibition of IL-18-induced cell migration comparable with that seen with control (Fig. 6). The same effect was seen with 25 or 10 mg/ml blocking Ab concentration. Significant inhibition of cell migration by blocking HMVEC avb3 before stimulation with bFGF and TNF-a was also demonstrated, while no change in cell migration occurred after stimulation with VEGF. Shown are the representative data from three separate assays.",

TNF-a is angiogenic in part via its action on integrin avb3 (34). Thus, we examined whether blocking avb3 would inhibit IL-18-induced angiogenesis in the HMVEC migration assay. HMVECs were first incubated with anti-avb3 Ab or nonspecific control IgG at 25 mg/ml for 1 h before and during the chemotaxis assay. IL-18 (10 nM) was then used to stimulate HMVEC migration, and comparison was made with the control stimulants bFGF and TNF-a. To illustrate a contrasting mechanism, VEGF was also used as another stimulant, which would not be expected to be inhibited by blocking avb3, since the angiogenic ability of VEGF is thought to occur via the integrin avb5 (42). Blocking HMVEC avb3 resulted in significant inhibition of IL-18-induced cell migration comparable with that seen with control (Fig. 6). The same effect was seen with 25 or 10 mg/ml blocking Ab concentration. Significant inhibition of cell migration by blocking HMVEC avb3 before stimulation with bFGF and TNF-a was also demonstrated, while no change in cell migration occurred after stimulation with VEGF. Shown are the representative data from three separate assays.",

              "summary_text": "BACKGROUND: Bone sialoprotein (BSP) interacts separately with both matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and integrin alpha(v)beta3 and is overexpressed in many metastatic tumors. Its role in tumor biology, however, remains unclear. We investigated whether BSP enhances cancer cell invasiveness by forming a trimolecular complex with MMP-2 and cell-surface integrin alpha(v)beta3. METHODS: Invasiveness of breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid tumor cell lines was measured with a modified Boyden chamber assay. Binding and co-localization of BSP, MMP-2, and integrin alpha(v)beta3 were investigated with immunoprecipitation and in situ hybridization. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Treatment with BSP increased invasiveness of many breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid cancer cells through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner. BSP at 50 nM increased the invasiveness of SW-579 thyroid cancer cells (95.2 units, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 90.4 to 100 units) by approximately 10-fold compared with that of untreated control SW-579 cells (9.1 units, 95% CI = 5.7 to 12.5 units) (P<.001). Addition of an inactive mutated BSP, in which BSP's integrin-binding RGD tripeptide was altered, or addition of integrin alpha(v)beta3-blocking antibodies resulted in invasiveness equivalent to that of untreated cells. Inhibiting cellular MMP-2 activity with chemical inhibitors or a specific antibody also blocked BSP-enhanced invasiveness. Osteopontin and dentin matrix protein 1, proteins related to BSP that also bind integrin alpha(v)beta3 and form complexes with other MMPs (but not MMP-2), did not enhance invasiveness. Immunoprecipitation showed that a complex containing BSP, integrin alpha(v)beta3, and MMP-2 formed in vitro. Addition of BSP increased the amount of MMP-2 bound by cells in an integrin-dependent fashion. Co-expression of BSP, integrin alpha(v)beta3, and MMP-2 in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells was shown by in situ hybridization. CONCLUSION: Cancer cells appear to become more invasive when BSP forms a cell-surface trimolecular complex by linking MMP-2 to integrin alpha(v)beta3.",

              "summary_text": "Growth factor-induced neovascularization has received a great deal of attention because it is fundamental to the growth and metastasis of solid tumors. This multistep process requires extensive signaling through growth factor receptors and integrins. Among the integrins involved in this process, integrin alphavbeta3 is specific to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced angiogenesis. Here we show that junctional adhesion molecule 1/A (JAM-1/A) and alphavbeta3 form a complex in the absence of bFGF. JAM-1, which is normally localized at the cell-cell junctions of quiescent endothelial cells, redistributes to the cell surface on bFGF treatment. Blockage of the extracellular domain of JAM-1 inhibits bFGF-induced endothelial cell morphology, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Additionally, mutation in the JAM-1 cytoplasmic domain blocks bFGF-induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and ablates its ability to induce endothelial cell tube formation, suggesting that signaling through JAM-1 is key to bFGF-induced signaling. Immunoprecipitation analysis suggests that bFGF signaling dissociates the JAM-1/ alphavbeta3 complex, allowing for signaling through JAM-1 and alphavbeta3. In addition, blockage of either JAM-1 or alphavbeta3 inhibits bFGF-induced MAP kinase activation. Thus, our results suggest that signaling through JAM-1 and alphavbeta3 is necessary for bFGF-induced angiogenesis.",

              "summary_text": "Metastatic cancer cells, like trophoblasts of the developing placenta, are invasive and must escape immune surveillance to survive. Complement has long been thought to play a significant role in the tumor surveillance mechanism. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN, ETA-1) are expressed by trophoblasts and are strongly up-regulated by many tumors. Indeed, BSP has been shown to be a positive indicator of the invasive potential of some tumors. In this report, we show that BSP and OPN form rapid and tight complexes with complement Factor H. Besides its key role in regulating complement-mediated cell lysis, Factor H also appears to play a role when hijacked by invading organisms in enabling cellular evasion of complement. We have investigated whether BSP and OPN may play a similar role in tumor cell complement evasion by testing to see whether these glycoproteins could promote tumor cell survival. Recombinant OPN and BSP can protect murine erythroleukemia cells from attack by human complement as well as human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and U-266 myeloma cells from attack by guinea pig complement. The mechanism of this gain of function by tumor cell expression of BSP or OPN has been defined using specific peptides and antibodies to block BSP and OPN protective activity. The expression of BSP and OPN in tumor cells provides a selective advantage for survival via initial binding to alpha(V)beta(3) integrin (both) or CD44 (OPN) on the cell surface, followed by sequestration of Factor H to the cell surface and inhibition of complement-mediated cell lysis.",

CD44v6 is a splice variant of CD44 which has been identified as a marker of cancer progression. In this study, immortalized liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) were used to examine the effect of OPN on two isoforms of CD44: CD44 standard (CD44 s) and CD44v6. Western blots demonstrated that OPN up-regulated plasma membrane CD44v6 protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. CD44v6 levels returned to control levels when OPN-alphavbeta3-integrin binding was blocked by an RGD peptide or tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited. OPN significantly increased CD44v6 protein synthesis, while simultaneously decreasing protein degradation. Steady-state mRNA levels of both CD44s and CD44v6 were unaltered in the presence of OPN stimulation. OPN increased HepG2 in vitro adhesion to hyaluronate (HA); excess soluble HA extinguished OPN-mediated HepG2 adhesion, indicating CD44 dependence. In conclusion, OPN binds to the alphavbeta3-integrin to increase plasma membrane CD44v6 expression and augment in vitro adhesion to HA. This may contribute to the mechanism by which OPN enhances metastatic behavior in hepatocellular cancer cells.",

We have localized the alpha(v)beta(3) binding sites in gammaC using gammaC-derived synthetic peptides. We found that two peptides GWTVFQKRLDGSV(190-202) and GVYYQGGTYSKAS(346-358) block the alpha(v)beta(3) binding to gammaC or alpha(E)C, block the alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated clot retraction, and induce the ligand-induced binding site 2 (LIBS2) epitope in alpha(v)beta(3). Neither peptide affects fibrinogen binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3). Scrambled or inverted peptides were not effective. These results suggest that the two gammaC-derived peptides directly interact with alpha(v)beta(3) and specifically block alpha(v)beta(3)-gammaC or alpha(E)C interaction. The two sequences are located next to each other in the gammaC crystal structure, although they are separate in the primary structure. Asp-199, Ser-201, Gln-350, Thr-353, Lys-356, Ala-357, and Ser-358 residues are exposed to the surface. This suggests that the two sequences are part of alpha(v)beta(3) binding sites in fibrinogen gammaC domain. We also found that tenascin C C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain specifically binds to alpha(v)beta(3). Notably, a peptide WYRNCHRVNLMGRYGDNNHSQGVNWFHWKG from this domain that includes the sequence corresponding to gammaC GVYYQGGTYSKAS(346-358) specifically binds to alpha(v)beta(3), suggesting that fibrinogen and tenascin C C-terminal domains interact with alpha(v)beta(3) in a similar manner.",

We describe here a novel pathway that modulates cell migration and that is activated by alphavbeta3 and, as downstream effector, by cdc2 (cdk1). We report that alphavbeta3 expression in LNCaP (beta3-LNCaP) prostate cancer cells causes increased cdc2 mRNA levels as evaluated by gene expression analysis, and increased cdc2 protein and kinase activity levels. We provide three lines of evidence that increased levels of cdc2 contribute to a motile phenotype on integrin ligands in different cell types. First, increased levels of cdc2 correlate with more motile phenotypes of cancer cells. Second, ectopic expression of cdc2 increases cell migration, whereas expression of dominant-negative cdc2 inhibits migration. Third, cdc2 inhibitors reduce cell migration without affecting cell adhesion. We also show that cdc2 increases cell migration via specific association with cyclin B2, and we unravel a novel pathway of cell motility that involves, downstream of cdc2, caldesmon. cdc2 and caldesmon are shown here to localize in membrane ruffles in motile cells. These results show that cdc2 is a downstream effector of the alphavbeta3 integrin, and that it promotes cell migration.",

              "summary_text": "Integrin-mediated cell attachment and growth factor stimulation often act synergistically on cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. Some of these synergistic effects depend on the physical interaction of integrins with growth factor receptors. Here we examine the nature of the physical interaction between the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGF-Rbeta) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2, also known as KDR and flk-1). Both of these RTKs associate with the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin but do not associate with beta(1) integrins. Furthermore, growth factor stimulation of these RTKs promotes increased cell proliferation and migration when cells are attached to the alpha(v)beta(3) ligand, vitronectin. We show that alpha(v)beta(3) in which the beta(3) cytoplasmic domain is deleted or replaced with the beta(1) cytoplasmic domain coimmunoprecipitates with PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2. The beta(3) extracellular domain alone was sufficient for the PDGF-Rbeta association whereas the VEGF-R2 association required the presence of the alpha(v) subunit. Activation of the RTKs by their ligands was not required for them to associate with the integrin. Cell migration to PDGF was enhanced in the cells transfected with the chimeric subunit containing the beta(3) extracellular domain but not when that domain came from the beta(1) subunit. These results show that the interactions that lead to the association of the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin with PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2 and enhancement of RTK activity take place outside the cell.",

All three proteins are also associated with the activated receptor. Through the use of cell lines each lacking an individual JAK, we find that in contrast to interferon signaling, PDGF-induced JAK phosphorylation and activation of STAT1 and STAT3 is independent of the presence of any other single JAK but does require receptor tyrosine kinase activity.",

This is supported by the observation that contact between endothelial cells and periendothelial support cells, such as pericytes or smooth muscle cells, stabilizes new blood vessels, promotes endothelial survival, and inhibits endothelial cell proliferation (9). The fact that only immature vessels may be forced into regression by interference with VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling is of therapeutic relevance since the literature on the pericyte coverage on tumor vessels suggests that the pericyte-free fraction of tumor blood vessels may be little or none for a significant number of both experimental and human tumor types (10-14). As a consequence, additional targeting of pericyte recruitment and pericyte/ endothelial cell interaction may enhance tumor vessel destruction after interference with VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling. Although the detailed molecular basis of how pericytes confer vessel stabilization remains unknown, studies of embryogenesis have highlighted the involvement of the angiopoetin (Ang)- 1/Tie2 system and the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B/PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-? system.

              "summary_text": "To determine the mechanism by which IL-18 mediates angiogenesis, we hypothesized that IL-18 may act through integrins present on HMVECs. TNF-a is angiogenic in part via its action on integrin avb3 (34). Thus, we examined whether blocking avb3 would inhibit IL-18-induced angiogenesis in the HMVEC migration assay. HMVECs were first incubated with anti-avb3 Ab or nonspecific control IgG at 25 mg/ml for 1 h before and during the chemotaxis assay. IL-18 (10 nM) was then used to stimulate HMVEC migration, and comparison was made with the control stimulants bFGF and TNF-a. To illustrate a contrasting mechanism, VEGF was also used as another stimulant, which would not be expected to be inhibited by blocking avb3, since the angiogenic ability of VEGF is thought to occur via the integrin avb5 (42). Blocking HMVEC avb3 resulted in significant inhibition of IL-18-induced cell migration comparable with that seen with control (Fig. 6). The same effect was seen with 25 or 10 mg/ml blocking Ab concentration. Significant inhibition of cell migration by blocking HMVEC avb3 before stimulation with bFGF and TNF-a was also demonstrated, while no change in cell migration occurred after stimulation with VEGF. Shown are the representative data from three separate assays.",
