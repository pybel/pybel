      "boundary_conditions": "The human model sets were built to represent healthy processes and were then enhanced with COPD data to represent early COPD (GOLD stage I and II) processes. If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. For a mechanism predicted from COPD data it was incorporated into a network with an edge based on COPD studies if available, and if not healthy context was used to incorporate these COPD mechanisms. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. We excluded cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, all virus infections, all bacterial infections, septic pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), allergic responses/asthma, pneumoconiosis, and COPD exacerbations. We also excluded animal inhalation studies with solid particles (titanium dioxide, quartz, asbestos, carbon black, diesel exhaust etc). For the in vitro-specific exclusion criteria we excluded tumor-derived cell lines, immortalized cell lines, neuronal cells, and cell types that cannot be found in the respiratory/vascular system. There were some exceptions where we included immortalized cell lines and non-lung cell types for canonical mechanisms where there was evidence that the relationship was not tissue-specific but could also take place in the lung. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

Although cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were more abundant in the cytoplasmic fraction after partial hepatectomy, kinase activity was detected primarily in the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were activated by recombinant cyclin H/Cdk7.

CONCLUSION: The lower survival of patients with the highest levels of PLZF suggests that this protein may be a marker of progression in B-CLL. The absence of co-ordinated regulation of PLZF and cyclin A genes in B-CLL and in a malignant B-cell line may indicate a loss of cyclin A control by PLZF in B-CLL and other B-cell disorders. Deregulation of PLZF could thus play a role in B-cell malignancy. In transactivation assays, PLZF inhibited the activity of the cyclin A reporters by 50%, demonstrating that PLZF can repress cyclin A expression in non-malignant B lymphocytes. However, in B-CLL patients, the level of cyclin A expression was found to be within the normal range. Altered PLZF function in B lymphoid malignancies was further corroborated in the PLZF-regulatable DG75 clones, where induction of PLZF expression did not significantly alter the levels of cyclin A expression, the cell growth kinetics, or the cell cycle phase distribution.",

Although cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were more abundant in the cytoplasmic fraction after partial hepatectomy, kinase activity was detected primarily in the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were activated by recombinant cyclin H/Cdk7.

Although cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were more abundant in the cytoplasmic fraction after partial hepatectomy, kinase activity was detected primarily in the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were activated by recombinant cyclin H/Cdk7. Because endogenous Cdk7 activity was found in the nucleus, this suggests that activation of cyclin D1/Cdk4 requires nuclear importation and subsequent phosphorylation by cyclin H/Cdk7.",

In addition, SOCS1 induced high levels of p53 and its target, p21; a reduction in Rb phosphorylation; and the inhibition of E2F target genes such as Mcm6 (Figure 3B). Intriguingly, during SOCS1-induced senescence, the increase in p53 levels was accompanied with serine 15 phosphorylation of p53 (Figure 3B) and activation of the DNA damage-regulated kinases ATM and Chk2 (Figure 3C).

At least five phosphorylation states have been resolved (Zernik-Kobak et al., 1997). In unirradiated cells, RPA2 is phosphorylated primarily at Ser23 and Ser29 (Dutta and Stillman, 1992; Pan and Hurwitz, 1993). DNA damage by UV, IR, camptothecin, or etoposide induces phosphorylation of additional sites (Zernik-Kobak et al., 1997; Shao et al., 1999). These hyperphosphorylations are attributable to DNA-PK (Shao et al., 1999) and independently to ATM (Gately et al., 1998). <s12>  ATM (or an ATM-associated kinase other than DNA-PK or ATM-related protein) hyperphosphorylates RPA2 on serine and threonine residues in response to DNA damage; the reaction is dependent on both ssDNA and linear dsDNA (Gately et al., 1998). <s13> DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 prevents the binding of RPA to p53 (Abramova et al., 1997).",

However, cyclin G does not cause similar reductions in p53 levels in ATM-mutated cells. We also show that translocation of cyclin G to the nucleus requires functional ATM.",

As well as modifying BRCA1, the ATM protein kinase can phosphorylate FANCD2 on several residues, including serine 222, following exposure to ionizing radiation77. Ser222 phosphorylation is required for the intra-S-phase arrest and is, in turn, dependent on the protein kinase NBS1, which is a component of the trimeric MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex78. FANCD2 can also be phosphorylated in an ATM-independent manner by the ATR kinase79,which signals an intra-S-phase arrest that is triggered by ultraviolet radiation or DNA-crosslinking agents46.Here, too, FANCD2 phosphorylation depends on NBS1, which is required to fully enforce the S-phase checkpoint. The participation of FANCD2 in ionizingradiation- activated checkpoint responses through phosphorylation on Ser222 seems to be independent78 of its mono-ubiquitylation on Lys561, which promotes the translocation of FANCD2 to damage-induced nuclear foci that contain BRCA1 and RAD51, and that are presumed sites of DNA repair. Similarly, FANCD2 foci do not require ATR-dependent phosphorylation79.",

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and",

We and others have previously shown that these growth factors increase insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) number and mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells and that this effect is transcriptionally regulated. To study the mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved, IGF-1R promoter reporter constructs were transiently transfected in CHO-AT1 cells that overexpress angiotensin AT1 receptors. Our findings indicate that Ang II and bFGF significantly increased IGF-1R promoter activity up to 7- and 3-fold, respectively. The effect induced by Ang II was mediated via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism, since tyrphostin A25 largely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in promoter activity. In addition, co-transfection of dominant negative Ras, Raf, and MEK1 or pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 dose-dependently decreased both the Ang II- and bFGF-induced increase in IGF-1R transcription and protein expression, suggesting that the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathway is required for both growth factors. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to act as second messengers in Ang II-induced signaling, and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is redox-sensitive. While co-transfection of dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant completely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in transcription, it had no effect on the bFGF signaling. In contrast, co-transfection studies indicated that the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, and c-Jun and the Janus kinase 2 kinase are required in the signaling pathway of bFGF, whereas only dominant c-Jun inhibited the Ang II-induced effect. In summary, these data demonstrate that Ang II and bFGF increase IGF-1R gene transcription via distinct as well as shared pathways and have important implications for understanding growth-stimulatory effects of these growth factors on vascular cells.",

However, CNTF has also been shown to cause weight loss in a variety of rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes, whereas a modified form also causes weight loss in humans. CNTF administration can correct or improve hyperinsulinemia, hyperphagia, and hyperlipidemia associated with these models of obesity. In order to investigate the effects of CNTF on fat cells, we examined the expression of CNTF receptor complex proteins (LIFR, gp130, and CNTFRalpha) during adipocyte differentiation and the effects of CNTF on STAT, Akt, and MAPK activation. We also examined the ability of CNTF to regulate the expression of adipocyte transcription factors and other adipogenic proteins. Our studies clearly demonstrate that the expression of two of the three CNTF receptor complex components, CNTFRalpha and LIFR, decreases during adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, gp130 expression is relatively unaffected by differentiation. In addition, preadipocytes are more sensitive to CNTF treatment than adipocytes, as judged by both STAT 3 and Akt activation. Despite decreased levels of CNTFRalpha expression in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, CNTF treatment of these cells resulted in a time-dependent activation of STAT 3. Chronic treatment of adipocytes resulted in a substantial decrease in fatty-acid synthase and a notable decline in SREBP-1 levels but had no effect on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, acrp30, adipocyte-expressed STAT proteins, or C/EBPalpha. However, CNTF resulted in a significant increase in IRS-1 expression. CNTFRalpha receptor expression was substantially induced in the fat pads of four rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes as compared with lean littermates. Moreover, we demonstrated that CNTF can activate STAT 3 in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in vivo. In summary, CNTF affects adipocyte gene expression, and the specific receptor for this cytokine is induced in rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes.",

We found that treatment of adult male mice by ISO (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) caused a delayed STAT3 activation (at 60-120 min), which was fully abolished by beta-AR antagonist, propranolol. ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly enhanced by phosphodiesterase inhibitor amrinone, indicating that cAMP is critically involved in beta-AR-mediated STAT3 activation. In addition, beta-AR stimulation significantly increased gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1). IL-6 protein levels in serum and mouse myocardium were also significantly increased in response to ISO treatment. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, IL-6 level was enhanced significantly after ISO (10-6 mol/liter) stimulation for 2 h and then peaked at 12 h, whereas the response of IL-6 in cultured cardiomyocytes to ISO stimulation was not significant, suggesting that ISO-induced increase in IL-6 is primarily from cardiac fibroblasts rather than cardiomyocytes. Most importantly, IL-6 could activate STAT3 in a time-dependent manner in cultured cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of IL-6 level by anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibody clearly attenuated ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in myocardium. Taken together, these results indicate that beta-AR stimulation leads to a delayed STAT3 activation via an IL-6 family of cytokine-mediated pathway and that cardiac fibroblasts, but not cardiomyocytes, is probably the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium.",

Holbro and N.E. Hynes, unpublished data). As a consequence, these cells have decreased PI-3K/PKB signaling, a reduction in D-type cyclin levels, and show an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A main effector of ErbB signaling, the PI-3K/PKB pathway, is particularly important in mediating cell survival 103 T. Holbro et al. / Experimental Cell Research 284 (2003) 99-110 since several PKB substrates directly control various apoptotic processes. The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha has defined proinflammatory roles in Crohn's disease but its role in fibrosis is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that TNFalpha increases collagen accumulation and proliferation in intestinal myofibroblasts and has additive effects in combination with insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I. The mechanisms, TNF receptor isoform, and downstream signaling pathways were examined. Intestinal myofibroblasts from wild-type (WT) mice or mice homozygous for disruption of genes encoding TNFR1 (TNFR1-/-), TNFR2 (TNFR2-/-), or both (TNFR1/2-/-), were treated with TNFalpha, IGF-I, or both. In WT cells, TNFalpha and IGF-I stimulated type I collagen accumulation and DNA synthesis in an additive manner. IGF-I, but not TNFalpha, stimulated type I collagen gene activation. TNFalpha, but not IGF-I, induced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) expression and reduced matrix metalloproteinases-2 activity and collagen degradation. TNFalpha also activated ERK1/2. These responses to TNFalpha were absent in TNFR2-/- and TNFR1/2-/- myofibroblasts, whereas TNFR1-/- cells showed similar responses to WT. Inhibition of ERK1/2 diminished TNFalpha induced DNA synthesis in WT and TNFR1-/- cells. Differences in TNFalpha-induced STAT3/DNA binding activity and not NFkappaB and AP-1 transcriptional activation correlated with impaired collagen accumulation/TIMP-1 induction in TNFR2(-/-) cells. Constitutively active STAT3 rescued TIMP-1 expression in TNFR2-/- cells. We conclude that TNFalpha and IGF-I may additively contribute to fibrosis during intestinal inflammation. TNFR2 is a primary mediator of fibrogenic actions of TNFalpha acting through ERK1/2 to stimulate proliferation and through STAT3 to stimulate TIMP-1 and inhibit collagen degradation.",

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The differentiation of T helper 17 (TH17) cells is initiated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), downstream of interleukin-6 (IL-6)- and IL-21-induced signalling.

These two factors establish the TH17-cell-associated gene-expression programme, leading to the production of IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22. STAT5, which is downstream of IL-2 signalling, and STAT1, which is downstream of IL-27 signalling, as well as ETS1, are negative regulators of TH17-cell differentiation. In addition, the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), which is induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signalling, antagonizes the TH17-cell developmental programme.

These data indicated that the activation of p38 MAPK by CO is PI3K/Akt-dependent. We next tested whether CO modulated STAT1 and STAT3 via PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. We pretreated PAEC with SB203580 and observed that CO can no longer modulate STAT1 or STAT3 activation (Fig. 2D, lane 5). Consistent with our data that PI3K/Akt activation is upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO during A-R (Fig. 2C), when we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, CO lost its ability to decrease STAT1 and increase STAT3 activation during A-R (Fig. 2D, lane 4). These data demonstrated that the opposing effect of CO on STAT1 and STAT3 activation is dependent upon PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. ",

IL-17 also leads to the induction of many pro-inflammatory factors, including TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta, suggesting an important role for IL-17 in localizing and amplifying inflammation[72-74].",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

STATs were thought to exist as latent, cytoplasmic monomers and activation to require dimer formation was mediated exclusively by reciprocal phospho-tyrosine/SH2-domain interactions, but recent evidence of cytoplasmic STAT complexes, including dimers, and unphosphorylated STATs in the nucleus has challenged these notions. STAT complexes detected by conventional SDS-PAGE, including a STAT3 dimer, have been reported. We show that such complexes can form during cell lysis and be disrupted with DTT, suggesting inter-chain disulphide bridging. STAT3 also forms a related complex in cells upon oxidative stress. We map the interaction to the amino-terminal domain of STAT3 and use mass spectrometry to implicate cysteine 259 as the reactive residue. The redox sensitivity of STAT3 may be significant, given its activation in cells in response to reactive oxygen species.",

Gene Array Analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cells, reverse transcribed, amplified with biotinylated nucleotides, fragmented, and hybridized against the Affymetrix U133A oligonucleotide arrays. The arrays were analyzed using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix) with the default parameters for the statistical algorithm and probe set scaling (set to 500). The data were then filtered so that the absolute value of the fold change was >2.0 and the change P value was <0.001. Genes that were scored as absent in experimental and baseline files as well as genes scored as increasing but absent in the experimental file were removed. Using an in-house program, the list of up- and down-regulated genes from each cell line were compared and only those genes that were either increased or decreased, respectively, were included.",

Furthermore, it is shown that Nhlh2 binds to E-box motifs found adjacent to STAT3 sites in the PC1/3 promoter both in vitro and in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, two different protein-protein interaction assays confirm the presence of a STAT3:Nhlh2 heterodimer on the PC1/3 promoter. The Nhlh2:STAT3 heterodimer may be an important transcriptional regulator of other hypothalamic genes in the leptin signaling pathway. These data confirm Nhlh2 as an integral element of the Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathway and are the first to demonstrate coordinated control of PC1/3 transcription by Nhlh2 and STAT3 after leptin stimulation.",

We show that the kinase domains of FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4 containing the activation loop mutation, when targeted to the plasma membrane by a myristylation signal, can transform NIH3T3 cells and induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Phosphorylation of Shp2, PLC-gamma, and MAPK was also stimulated by all three 'TDII-like' FGFR derivatives. Additionally, activation of Stat1 and Stat3 was observed in cells expressing the activated FGFR derivatives.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 mutant, we show that activation of Stat3 and its binding to the p21 promoter are required for DEP-induced expression of p21, suggesting that Stat3 plays an essential role in the induction of p21 by DEP.",

The up-regulation of SPI-3 mRNA expression is also confirmed by northern blotting. Most SPI-3 mRNA-positive cells simultaneously express synaptophysin, a marker for pinealocytes, but not glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker for astrocytes. This indicates that SPI-3 mRNA-positive cells are pinealocytes. Almost all SPI-3 mRNA-positive cells also showed translocation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) into nuclei after lipopolysaccharide injection. These data support previous in vitro results that SPI-3 expression is induced in a STAT3-mediated manner. In addition, the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) mRNAs, but not of interleukin 6 receptor mRNA, was up-regulated after systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment. Because these receptors are upstream of STAT3, the present results suggest that cytokines such as LIF and/or CNTF induce SPI-3 expression via STAT3 in the pineal gland in response to inflammatory stimulus. We conclude that although the functional consequences of SPI-3 in the pineal gland during systemic inflammation are unknown, SPI-3 may have a crucial role in preventing some degenerative proteolysis induced by inflammatory stimuli.",

              "summary_text": "Various studies, including several microarray expression analyses, have demonstrated that MYC proteins control the expression of many target genes (11-14). The resulting consequences on many different aspects of cell behavior and cell fate demand that this protein is precisely controlled. Too little or too much MYC protein and/or activity may severely affect proper functioning of cells and as a consequence affect their proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which may result in disease. As pointed out above this is most evident in cells that produce too much MYC, which is associated with tumorigenesis. Thus it is not surprising that the expression and function of this protein is regulated at multiple levels. The expression of the MYC gene is regulated by a wide variety of signals that control promoter activity, RNA polymerase elongation, and mRNA processing and collectively determine where, when, and how much MYC is synthesized (6). Here we will focus on mechanisms further downstream that impinge on MYC. The protein is subject to interdependent posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitinylation, suggesting that MYC proteins directly integrate the information of different signal transduction pathways. MYC Is Phosphorylated at Multiple Sites MYC proteins are phosphorylated at multiple sites distributed over the entire protein (Fig. 1). The first and major sites were identified almost 20 years ago within two areas, the acidic domain and near the basic region, and are substrates of protein kinase CK2, an enzyme that has broad biological activities including a role in tumorigenesis (15, 16). Nevertheless the functional relevance of these CK2 phosphorylation sites on MYC has remained elusive. However, in a recent study a correlation between CK2 activity and MYC protein levels was demonstrated, suggesting that CK2 stabilizes MYC(17).",

              "summary_text": "Involvement of Rheb in the insulin TOR S6K signaling pathway was further investigated in mammalian cells. Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

Several NPAT promoter constructs were strongly activated by E2F1. Deletion of nucleotides 5' to the putative E2F binding sites in the NPAT promoter did not impede the activation of the NPAT promoter by E2F1. In contrast, a deletion that removes  one putative E2F binding site (pGL-N86) significantly impaired  the activation of the promoter by E2F1, and deletion of both  putative E2F binding sites (pGL-N30) abolished the activation  of the promoter by E2F1 (Fig. 2B).

Because we previously reported that the regulation of G1 cyclins is a key factor in the G1/S transition phase in mesangial cells, we showed that overexpression of E2F1 induced protein expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E and increased promoter activity. Thus, we conclude that E2F1 plays an important role in the G1/S transition phase and acts on the mesangial cell cycle through two distinct pathways: (1) E2F1 directly transcribes an S-phase gene, and (2) E2F1 promotes cell cycle progression via the induction of cyclin D1 and cyclin E.",

We present evidence here that ICBP90 binds to methyl-CpG when at least one symmetrically methylated-CpG dinucleotides is presented as its recognition sequence. A SET and RING finger-associated (SRA) domain accounts for the high binding affinity of ICBP90 for methyl-CpG dinucleotides. This protein constitutes a complex with HDAC1 also via its SRA domain, and bound to methylated promoter regions of various tumor suppressor genes, including p16INK4Aand p14ARF, in cancer cells. It has been reported that expression of ICBP90 was upregulated by E2F-1, and we confirmed that the upregulation was caused by binding of E2F-1 to the intron1 of ICBP90, which contains two E2F-1-binding motifs. Our data also revealed accumulation of ICBP90 in breast-cancer cells, where it might suppress expression of tumor suppressor genes through deacetylation of histones after recruitment of HDAC1. The data reported here suggest that ICBP90 is involved in cell proliferation by way of methylation-mediated regulation of certain genes.",

In chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, endogenous E2F1 forms a complex with the promoter of the endogenous cdc2 gene in granule neurons, indicating that endogenous E2F1 is poised to activate transcription of the endogenous cdc2 gene in neurons.

TopBP1 is also known as a DNA damage response protein. In this study, we showed that the transcription of human MCM10 and TopBP1 is activated by transcription factors E2F1-3, but not by factors E2F4-7. Analysis of various MCM10 and TopBP1 promoter constructs showed that an E2F-responsive sequence in the vicinity of the transcription initiation site is necessary for the E2F1-induced activation of MCM10 and TopBP1 gene transcription, which is further suppressed by pRb. The promoter activities of human MCM10 and TopBP1 were demonstrated to be growth dependent via the E2F-responsive sequence. Although E2F1 was stabilized by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the mRNA expression level of TopBP1 was suppressed in HCT116 human diploid colon cancer cells. We showed, by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation that, in response to UV irradiation but not doxorubicin treatment, E2F4 accumulated on the MCM10 and TopBP1 promoters. Our data suggest a model in which UV irradiation-induced DNA damage depends, at least in part, on the accumulation of the E2F4 transcription factor on the MCM10 and TopBP1 promoters, which results in suppression of DNA replication.",

The proangiogenic phenotype in E2F1 deficiency is the result of overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is prevented by VEGF blockade. Under hypoxic conditions, E2F1 down-regulates the expression of VEGF promoter activity by associating with p53 and specifically down-regulating expression of VEGF but not other hypoxia-inducible genes, suggesting a promoter structure context-dependent regulation mechanism. We found that the minimum VEGF promoter mediating transcriptional repression by E2F1 features an E2F1- binding site with four Sp-1 sites in close proximity. These data disclose an unexpected function of endogenous E2F1: regulation of angiogenic activity via p53-dependent transcriptional control of VEGF expression.",

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

Several NPAT promoter constructs were strongly activated by E2F1. Deletion of nucleotides 5' to the putative E2F binding sites in the NPAT promoter did not impede the activation of the NPAT promoter by E2F1. In contrast, a deletion that removes  one putative E2F binding site (pGL-N86) significantly impaired  the activation of the promoter by E2F1, and deletion of both  putative E2F binding sites (pGL-N30) abolished the activation  of the promoter by E2F1 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that NPAT transcription is regulated by E2F, presumably through the E2F recognition sites in the promoter.",

RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and",

In cells lacking p53, E2F-1 can act through p73, a member of p53 family that activates some of the same target genes as p53. E2F-1 can also directly regulate the transcription of several different caspases and suppress cell survival pathways by suppressing Mcl-1 expression or by inhibiting NFkB-mediated antiapoptotic signaling.",

              "summary_text": "Regarding the third mechanism, the expression of GLUT4 is subjected to tissue-specific, hormonal and metabolic regulation (Charron et al. 1999). Studies in vivo clearly indicate that GLUT4 gene expression is down-regulated in states of relative insulin deficiency such as streptozotocin-induced diabetes and chronic fasting, a situation that is reversed by insulin treatment and refeeding (Sivitz et al. 1989). In primary cultures of brown adipocytes, insulin/IGF-I transactivated the full promoter GLUT4-CAT fusion gene and up-regulated the expression of the GLUT4 gene, producing a time-dependent mRNA accumulation and significantly increased the amount of protein located in total membrane fraction. Consequently, glucose uptake was augmented (Valverde et al. 1999b). Inhibition of PI3K with either wortmannin or LY294002 or transient transfection with constructs encoding dominant negative p85 down-regulated insulin-induced GLUT4 mRNA accumulation or GLUT4 protein content, as well as precluded the transactivation of the GLUT4 promoter (Valverde et al. 1999b). However, studies in white adipocytes and in skeletal muscle cells failed to establish a stimulatory role of insulin on GLUT4 expression (Flores-Riveros et al. 1993), suggesting that additional factors could be involved in this tissues. In this regard dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has been shown to increase GLUT4 expression in myocytes (Tortorella & Pilch 2002), as well as to interact with insulin on GLUT4 expression in white adipocytes (Hajduch et al. 1995).",

              "summary_text": "BACKGROUND: The receptor of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) contains the signal transduction protein gp130, which is also a component of the receptors of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-11, and oncostatin M. This suggests that these cytokines might share common signaling pathways. We previously reported that CNTF augments the levels of corticosterone (CS) and of IL-6 induced by IL-1 and induces the production of the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA). Since the elevation of serum CS is an important feedback mechanism to limit the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF), we have investigated the effect of CNTF on both TNF production and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To induce serum TNF levels, LPS was administered to mice at 30 mg/kg i.p. and CNTF was administered as a single dose of 10 micrograms/mouse i.v., either alone or in combination with its soluble receptor sCNTFR alpha at 20 micrograms/mouse. Serum TNF levels were the measured by cytotoxicity on L929 cells. In order to measure the effects of CNTF on LPS-induced TNF production in the brain, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with 2.5 micrograms/kg LPS. Mouse spleen cells cultured for 4 hr with 1 microgram LPS/ml, with or without 10 micrograms CNTF/ml, were also analyzed for TNF production. RESULTS: CNTF, administered either alone or in combination with its soluble receptor, inhibited the induction of serum TNF levels by LPS. This inhibition was also observed in the brain when CNTF and LPS were administered centrally. In vitro, CNTF only marginally affected TNF production by LPS-stimulated mouse splenocytes, but it acted synergistically with dexamethasone (DEX) in inhibiting TNF production. Most importantly, CNTF administered together with sCNTFR alpha protected mice against LPS-induced mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CNTF might act as a protective cytokine against TNF-mediated pathologies both in the brain and in the periphery.",

To better understand the early molecular signals responsible for the effects of Dex and RA, Affymetrix gene profiling was done on RNA isolated from 4-day-old mice after treatment with 1) diluent, 2) RA (1 mg/kg), 3) Dex (0.7 microg/pup), or 4) RA + Dex. Each sample was assayed in duplicate on U74Av2 GeneChips. Data were analyzed with Affymetrix suite 5.0, corrected for saturation, and evaluated with GeneSpring 5.1 software. Stringent filtering of data by the global error model and condition-to-condition comparisons was used to identify 46 genes demonstrating significantly different expression between the lungs of Dex- and RA + Dex-treated mice. A query of the gene ontology database revealed that the major biological processes affected by treatment with Dex and RA were cell growth/maintenance and cellular communication. On the basis of microarray data analysis, we hypothesize that Dex-induced inhibition of septation is associated with a block in angiogenesis due to downregulation of the kinase domain receptor (KDR), also known as VEGF receptor-2 and fetal liver kinase, and that the downregulation of KDR is prevented by treatment with RA.",

Our findings underscore the important role of GR signaling in the homeostasis of follicular epithelial SCs, and suggest that the reduction in their number may underlie the tumor suppressor effect of GR in the skin.......We found that not only the number of putative follicular SCs was decreased, but also their proliferative potential was markedly abrogated in K5.GR skin.",

XOR activation by PD98059, dexamethasone, or insulin was superinduced by a constitutively active derivative of STAT3, while a dominant negative derivative of STAT3 blocked the enhancing effect of PD98059 on XOR activation.

Thus, in the noncatalytic N-terminal region of the tPA molecule there are two additional domains as compared to the uPA molecule: a finger-domain and the second kringle-domain, which are responsible for specific binding to fibrin [24].  Precise timing and location of adequate extracellular proteolysis is provided by multiple mechanisms among which the mechanisms regulating the expression of plasminogen activators and of their inhibitors are especially important. A wide spectrum of hormones, growth factors, and cell environment factors are involved in the regulation of expression of the genes of plasminogen activators and of their inhibitors. The expression of uPA is activated by various inflammatory factors: cytokines [25], growth factors [26], and tumor promotors, such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate [27], whereas antiinflammatory agents, such as glucocorticoids, inhibit the expression of uPA [28].",

Urokinase can mediate the angiogenic effect of some growth factors not only by the localization of cell surface proteolysis but also by non-proteolytic mechanisms [160]. A fusion protein consisting of the amino terminal fragment of urokinase and of human serum albumin inhibits endothelial cell in vitro migration induced by bFGF and by VEGF [161], whereas a fusion protein consisting of the mouse uPA GFD and of the Fc-fragment of IgG inhibits bFGF and VEGF-stimulated branching morphogenesis in an endothelial cell tube formation assay on a fibrin matrix [162].  Retinoids stimulate endothelial cell tube formation also on fibrin matrices and addition of uPA to this system enhances this stimulation, whereas an antibody that blocked urokinase binding to the receptor inhibits the effects of uPA. In the same system, steroid hormones (testosterone, dexamethasone) inhibit tube formation and addition of uPA to the system prevents the effect of steroids [163].",

These data suggest either that in the obese rat the b3-AR gene is abnormally regulated in response to changes in sympathetic activity or that an adrenal factor, most probably corticosterone, is responsible for the low levels of P3-AR mRNA. Such a corticosterone effect may be mediated indirectly through insulin, which has been shown to downregulate the expression of b3-AR mRNA in 3T3- F442A cells (14). Thus, although the regulation of UCP mRNA by sympathetic activity and glucocorticoids is similar in lean and obese rats, the responses of b3-AR mRNA are opposite in the two genotypes.",

This was abolished by mutagenesis of a cAMP response element (CRE) at -53 to approximately -59bp as well as by cotransfection of a plasmid expressing dominant-negative CRE-binding protein (CREB). The phosphorylation level of CREB-1 was significantly increased by cortisol treatment of the amnion fibroblasts.Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that the binding of CREB-1 to the CRE of the COX-2 promoter was increased by cortisol treatment of the amnion fibroblasts.",

RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and",

Mutations within the 3(10) helix region of the p57 molecule completely abolished the ability to arrest the cell cycle at G1 in vivo. These results indicate that this region is specifically utilized by p57 in selectively inhibiting cyclin A or E/Cdk2+ activities. Thus the 3(10) helix motif may confer a specific regulatory mechanism by which p57 differentially regulates Cdk2 and Cdk4 activities.",

These data suggest that ATR may function upstream of p53 in a signal transduction cascade initiated upon DNA damage and provide a biochemical assay system for ATR activity.",

Like Aurora- B, Aurora-A interacts with PP1, and this interaction peaks at mitosis. A mechanism of regulation of Aurora-A by PP1 that is similar to that of Aurora-B (269) is suggested by the observation that PP1 dephosphorylates and thereby inactivates Aurora-A in vitro. Interestingly, PP1 is also an in vitro substrate for Aurora-A, and this phosphorylation results in the inactivation of the phosphatase.",

The changes in gene expression are consistent with the ChIP results and indicate that cyclin E/Cdk2 enhances, whereas IFN-?, through the activation of p27, represses Myc-activated transcription (and vice versa for Myc-repressed transcription) of genes involved in cellular senescence.

These results indicate that the degradation of p27 is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: translocation-coupled cytoplasmic ubiquitylation by KPC at the G0 G1 transition and nuclear ubiquitylation by SKP2 during S and G2 phases (see Supplementary information S2 (figure)). Given that, in a subset of breast cancers (32 out of 84 samples)45, p27 levels were low despite SKP2 not being expressed, it remains possible that the expression of KPC might be elevated in such cases. Surprisingly, SKP2 also binds to MYC through its MB2 and helix loop helix leucine zipper (HLHZip) domains, and thereby mediates its ubiquitylation and degradation. However, SKP2 unexpectedly increases the transactivation activity of MYC, indicating that SKP2 is a transcriptional cofactor. Consistent with this notion, MYC accumulates, but its transcriptional activity is reduced, in mouse Skp2 ko cells.",

Immunoprecipitation of c-Myc showed little co-immunoprecipitation of Smad3 in the presence of TGF-? stimulation, but after stimulation of the cells by TGF-? (4 ng/ml) for various periods of time, significant levels of Smad3 were detected in the c-Myc immunoprecipitates, with Smad3 detectable 15 min after TGF-? stimu-lation (Fig. 9A).",

The identification of N-myc target genes is an important step for understanding N-Myc biological functions in both physiological and pathological contexts. In this study, we describe the identification of N-Myc-responsive genes through chromatin immunoprecipitation and methylation-sensitive restriction analysis. Results show that N-Myc is a direct regulator of several identified genes, and that methylation of the CpG dinucleotide within the E-box prevents the access of N-Myc to gene promoters in vivo. Furthermore, methylation profile of the E-box within the promoters of EGFR and CASP8, two genes directly controlled by Myc, is cell type-specific, suggesting that differential E-box methylation may contribute to generating unique patterns of Myc-dependent transcription. This study illuminates a central role of DNA methylation in controlling N-Myc occupancy at gene promoters and modulating its transcriptional activity in cancer cells.",

MYC is a member of the MYC/MAX/MAD network of the basic region/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLHZ) domain transcriptional regulators (for a summary of the domain structure see Fig. 1). MYC proteins form obligatory heterodimers with MAX, and these complexes bind to specific E-box DNA sequences with the consensus 5beta-CACGTG (7). The transactivation domain (TAD) is localized at theNterminus, containing two highly conserved elements, Myc box (MB) I and II, that are particularly relevant for MYC regulation and cofactor recruitment, respectively (Fig. 1). Within the MYC/MAX/MAD network, MYC proteins are antagonized by several bHLHZ proteins collectively referred to as MAD proteins (for an overview of the network see Fig. S2A) (8).",

Down-regulation of cyclin D2 mRNA expression in differentiating HL60 cells is preceded by a switch of promoter occupancy from Myc/Max to Mad/Max complexes, loss of TRRAP binding, increased HDAC1 binding, and histone deacetylation. Thus, recruitment of TRRAP and regulation of histone acetylation are critical for transcriptional activation by Myc.",

Mxi1 interacts specifically with Max to form heterodimers that efficiently bind to the Myc-Max consensus recognition site. When bound to DNA by a LexA moiety in yeast, Mxi1 does not stimulate transcription. mxi1 mRNA is expressed in many tissues, and its expression is elevated in U-937 myeloid leukemia cells that have been stimulated to differentiate. These facts are consistent with a model in which Mxi1-Max heterodimers indirectly inhibit Myc function in two ways: first, by sequestering Max, thus preventing the formation of Myc-Max heterodimers, and second, by competing with Myc-Max heterodimers for binding to target sites.",

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

We now show that Myc is bound to the cyclin D2 promoter in vivo. Binding of Myc induces cyclin D2 expression and histone acetylation at a single nucleosome in a MycBoxII/TRRAP-dependent manner. Down-regulation of cyclin D2 mRNA expression in differentiating HL60 cells is preceded by a switch of promoter occupancy from Myc/Max to Mad/Max complexes, loss of TRRAP binding, increased HDAC1 binding, and histone deacetylation. Thus, recruitment of TRRAP and regulation of histone acetylation are critical for transcriptional activation by Myc.",

By treating the cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (TM), which specifically activates MycER(TM) (13), and by simultaneous treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CX), we examined whether expression of the H-ferritin gene could be downregulated upon activation of preexisting MycER(TM) in the absence of new protein synthesis. Treatment with TM (with or without CX treatment, but not CX alone) led to a -60% reduction in H-ferritin RNA expression within 12 hours (Fig. IE). Because the half-life of H-ferritin RNA is 10 to 12 hours (14), the kinetics of c-MYC-induced down-regulation and the independence of new protein synthesis are consistent with a direct effect of c-MYC on H-ferritin gene expression",

By treating the cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (TM), which specifically activates MycER(TM) (13), and by simultaneous treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CX), we examined whether expression of the H-ferritin gene could be downregulated upon activation of preexisting MycER(TM) in the absence of new protein synthesis. Treatment with TM (with or without CX treatment, but not CX alone) led to a -60% reduction in H-ferritin RNA expression within 12 hours (Fig. IE). Because the half-life of H-ferritin RNA is 10 to 12 hours (14), the kinetics of c-MYC-induced down-regulation and the independence of new protein synthesis are consistent with a direct effect of c-MYC on H-ferritin gene expression",

These findings were correlated with decreased expression of genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 3gamma, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and retinoid X receptor.% These results indicate that c- myc overexpression may counteract diabetic changes by controlling hepatic glucose metabolism, both directly by altering the expression of metabolic genes and through the expression of key transcription factor genes.",

In addition, SOCS1 induced high levels of p53 and its target, p21; a reduction in Rb phosphorylation; and the inhibition of E2F target genes such as Mcm6 (Figure 3B). Intriguingly, during SOCS1-induced senescence, the increase in p53 levels was accompanied with serine 15 phosphorylation of p53 (Figure 3B) and activation of the DNA damage-regulated kinases ATM and Chk2 (Figure 3C).

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa.

Phosphorylations of Cdks are facilitated by Cyclin binding and stabilize the Cyclin:Cdk complex (Jackman and Pines, 1997). Human Myt1 phosphorylates and inactivates Cdk1 associated with cyclins A and B but does not phosphorylate Cdk2 or Cdk4 complexes (Booher et al., 1997) (unlike wee1, which can phosphorylate both Cdk1 and Cdk2). Myt1 is membrane bound to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Phosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 occurs when the cycB:Cdk1 complex assembles in the cytoplasm (Pines and Hunter, 1994). Wee1, however, is in the nucleus; hence another kinase may be operating in the cytoplasm (Matsuura and Wang, 1996). Thr14 phosphorylation precedes Tyr15 phosphorylation (Liu et al., 1997).",

RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and",

Lung level of SIRT1 is reduced in response to CS or oxidative/carbonyl stress, which leads to acetylation and degradation of FOXO3 and culminates in stress-induced premature senescence. The senescence of lung cells is a contributing factor to airspace enlargement and emphysema. NF-kB is also acetylated and activated in response to CS exposure as a result of SIRT1 reduction. However, inhibition of NF-kB-dependent lung inflammation does not prevent the progression of airspace enlargement. SIRT1 activation by overexpression and pharmacological means protects the lungs against cellular senescence and emphysematous changes.",

KLF4 silencing led to alterations in epithelial cell morphology and migration, indicative of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Consistent with these changes, decreased levels of KLF4 also resulted in the loss of E-cadherin protein and mRNA. Promoter/reporter analyses revealed decreased E-cadherin promoter activity with KLF4 silencing, while chromatin immunoprecipitation identified endogenous KLF4 binding to the GC-rich/E-box region of this promoter. Furthermore, forced expression of KLF4 in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cell line was sufficient to restore E-cadherin expression and suppress migration and invasion. ",

Members of the latter group include p21CIP1/WAF1, p27KIP1, and p57KIP2, which share structural homology and inhibit CDKs in a concentrationdependent manner.",

Further, many ER coactivators possess intrinsic HAT activities, including CBP/p300, p/CAF, and TAFII250 [19-21].

This deficiency in RB-mediated transcriptional repression and cell cycle inhibition was rescued through ectopic coexpression of BRG-1. We also demonstrate that 3T3-derived cells, which inducibly express a dominant-negative BRG-1, arrest by PSM-RB and p16ink4a in the absence of dominant-negative BRG-1 expression; however, cell cycle arrest was abrogated on induction of dominant-negative BRG-1. These findings demonstrate that BRG-1 loss renders cells resistant to RB-mediated cell cycle progression, and that disruption of RB signaling through loss of cooperating factors occurs in cancer cells.",

BRG1 and BAF155, mammalian homologs of yeast SWI2 and SWI3, respectively, are found in cyclin E complexes and are phosphorylated by cyclin E-associated kinase activity. In this report, we show that overexpression of BRG1 causes growth arrest and induction of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, which can be overcome by cyclin E. Our results suggest that cyclin E may modulate the activity of the SWI-SNF apparatus to maintain the chromatin in a transcriptionally permissive state.",

              "summary_text": "Insulin Stimulated phosphorylation cascade This pathway involves the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins and/or Shc, which in turn interact with the adapter protein Grb2, recruiting the Son-of-sevenless (SOS) exchange protein to the plasma membrane for activation of Ras. The activation of Ras also requires stimulation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, through its interaction with receptor substrates such as Gab-1 or IRS1/2. Activated ERK can translocate into the nucleus, where it catalyses the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as p62TCF, Blockade of the pathway with dominant negative mutants or pharmacological inhibitors prevents the stimulation of cell growth by insulin, but has no effect on the metabolic actions of the hormone54. Insulin increases synthesis and blocks the degradation of proteins through activation of mTOR. The stimulation of this protein kinase involves PI(3)K activation, although another signal may also be required56. mTOR can control the mammalian translation machinery by direct phosphorylation and activation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70rsk)57, as well as phosphorylation of the initiation factor 4E for eukaryotic translation (eIF-4E) inhibitor, PHAS1 or 4E-binding protein 1 (ref. 58). P70rsk activates ribosome biosynthesis by phosphorylating the ribosomal S6 protein, producing increased translation of mRNAs with a 58-terminal oligopyrimidine tract. P70rsk also requires a second PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent phosphorylation, presumably catalysed by PDK1. Phosphorylation of PHAS-1 by mTOR results in its dissociation from eIF-2, allowing capdependent translation of mRNAs with a highly structured 58-untranslated region. Although the mechanism of activation of mTOR remains unclear, it seems to require the presence of amino acids in the media for full activation by growth factors, and thus may also represent a nutrient sensor55. Glucose and lipid regulation Regulation of glycogen synthesis Insulin stimulates glycogen accumulation through a coordinated increase in glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. The hormone activates glycogen synthase by promoting its dephosphorylation, through the inhibition of kinases such as PKA or GSK-3 (ref. 59), and activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)60.",

              "summary_text": "These findings suggest that different signal transduction pathways as well as cell cycle-specific regulation are controlling the phosphorylation of Ser-62. Indeed RAS signaling that results in the activation of MAP kinases has been suggested to enhance MYC phosphorylation at Ser-62 (31, 32). Phosphorylation at this site appears to affect the stability of MYC at the G0 to G1 transition and to regulate MYC DNA binding (see below). Together these findings promote an attractive model because the RAS signaling pathway is activated by many growth factors and coincides with a strong increase in MYC protein levels upon reentry of cells into the cell cycle. However, because the evidence was derived from cells that overexpressed MYC from recombinant adenoviruses (31, 32), some caution is indicated. The massive overexpression of MYC in resting cells should stimulate cell cycle entry and apoptosis. Also it is not clear whether enough MAXis present in cells to build faithful MYC/MAX complexes. These artificial conditions may severely affect protein behavior, including stability and the response to RAS signaling. It should also be considered that MYC mRNA expression is strongly enhanced upon growth factor treatment of resting cells (6), and the analysis of de novo MYC protein synthesis has revealed a substantial increase in different cell types, including primary cells (33, 34). Thus the contribution of RAS signaling to MYC expression levels at the G0 to G1 transition will need further studying. It should also be noted that the role of MAPK in phosphorylating Ser-62 has been disputed (29). Once Ser-62 is phosphorylated, Thr-58 of MYC becomes a substrate for GSK3 (24). Most substrates of this enzyme must first be phosphorylated by another kinase at a Ser or Thr amino acid four residues C-terminal of the GSK3 site (35). This \\\"priming phosphate\\\" binds specifically into a pocket of the substrate recognition domain of GSK3 and explains why MYC and other substrates require this phosphorylation for the precise positioning of the phosphorylation site. Thus phosphorylation of Thr-58 appears to be strictly dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser-62. Similar findings were made for MYCN (36). Phosphorylation at Ser-54 by CDK1 leads to Thr-50 phosphorylation by GSK3, the two sites correspond to Ser-62 and Thr-58 in MYC, respectively, which enhances MYCN turnover during mitosis in neuronal cells.",

              "summary_text": "Insulin is the most-potent physiological anabolic agent known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates and lipids and inhibiting their degradation and release into the circulation. This action of the hormone is due in part to the acute regulation of metabolic enzymes through changes in their phosphorylation state. In fat, liver, and muscle, insulin stimulates the dephosphorylation of a number of enzymes involved in glycogen and lipid metabolism via activation of protein phosphatases. Numerous studies have indicated that protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is the primary phosphatase involved in insulin action. Although PP1 is a cytosolic protein, the phosphatase is compartmentalized in cells by discrete targeting subunits. These proteins confer substrate specificity to PP1 and mediate the specific regulation of intracellular pools of PP1 by a variety of extracellular signals. Four proteins have been described that target the phosphatase to the glycogen particle. G(M) and GL are expressed exclusively in striated muscle and liver, while protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) and R6 are more widely expressed. Despite a common targeting function, these four proteins are not highly conserved, suggesting profound differences in the mechanisms by which they contribute to the hormonal regulation of PP1 activity. Overexpression studies in cell lines or animals have revealed major differences among these proteins regarding basal glycogen levels and hormonal responsiveness. Furthermore, alterations in the expression or function of PP1 glycogen-targeting subunits may contribute to the onset of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

Here, we discuss interconnecting signaling pathways controlled by RB and p53, attempting to explain their potentially universal involvement in the etiology of cancer.

In contrast to other kinases, GSK3-beta is highly active in unstimulated cells and becomes inactivated by phosphorylation of serine 9 in response to several stimuli28. Recent studies have shown that this inactivation is required for cardiac hypertrophy. In cardiomyocytes, active GSK3-beta phosphorylates the transcription factors NF-AT and GATA4, inducing their translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and thus inhibiting their transcriptional activity25-27. In addition, active GSK3-beta also induces inhibition of elF2B, a principal initiation factor regulating protein synthesis.",

Insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis both by inactivating GSK3 and also by promoting the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase. The inactivation of GSK3 and GSK3 is achieved through phosphorylation of Ser21 and Ser9, respectively [12], and this is mediated by PKB in a PI3K-dependent fashion. Thus PI3K, PDK, PKB and GSK3 constitute one important arm of the insulin signalling cascade regulating glycogen synthesis. In addition to inducing an increase in glucose transport, over-expression of PKB elicited an inhibition of GSK3 and a concomitant increase in glycogen and protein synthesis a decrease in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, glucose transport and membrane ruffling, which coincided with reduced phosphorylation of PKB and p70S6K but normal phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK observed an inhibition of PKB phosphorylation and downstream p70S6K activation, which was attributable to a PP2A-type phosphatase activity Akt phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3, decreasing the rate of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase",

Through this interaction, -catenin augments the ligand-dependent activity of AR in prostate cancer cells.",

Because Wnt glycoproteins signal through Frizzled receptors resulting in the inhibition of GSK-3, we hypothesized that Wnt signaling could up-regulate Notch transcriptional activity in our system. To test this, we transfected NIH-3T3 with N2-IC in the presence of increasing amounts of Wnt1-hFc (26) along with the Hes1-luc reporter. Consistent with our hypothesis, coexpression of Wnt1 with N2-IC resulted in up-regulation of the Hes1 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A), whereas no effect was observed when Wnt1 was expressed in the absence of N2-IC (Fig 7A).",

Cytoplasmic retention of p27kip1 may occur through increased export or reduced import. Interaction of p27kip1 with JAB1/CNS5 or phosphorylation of serine 10 (S10) by the hKIS kinase promotes p27kip1 export from the nucleus, whereas phosphorylation of threonine 157 (T157) by the protein kinase B/AKT (AKT) impairs its import.",

Mutations within the 3(10) helix region of the p57 molecule completely abolished the ability to arrest the cell cycle at G1 in vivo. These results indicate that this region is specifically utilized by p57 in selectively inhibiting cyclin A or E/Cdk2+ activities. Thus the 3(10) helix motif may confer a specific regulatory mechanism by which p57 differentially regulates Cdk2 and Cdk4 activities.",

BRG1 and BAF155, mammalian homologs of yeast SWI2 and SWI3, respectively, are found in cyclin E complexes and are phosphorylated by cyclin E-associated kinase activity. In this report, we show that overexpression of BRG1 causes growth arrest and induction of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, which can be overcome by cyclin E. Our results suggest that cyclin E may modulate the activity of the SWI-SNF apparatus to maintain the chromatin in a transcriptionally permissive state.",

Adenoviruses expressing constitutively activated TGF-beta type I receptor led to robust actin reorganization and Rho activation, whereas the constitutively activated TGF-beta type I receptor with mutated Smad docking sites (L45 loop) did not affect either actin organization or Rho activity. In line with this, ectopic expression of the inhibitory Smad7 inhibited TGF-beta1-induced Rho activation and cytoskeletal reorganization. Our data define a novel pathway emanating from the TGF-beta type I receptor and leading to regulation of actin assembly, via the kinase LIMK2.",

              "summary_text": "Chloride channels, like Na+ channels, are more frequently activated by cytochalasin and inactivated by increasing actin cross linking, but again, there are exceptions to a simple interpretation, since F-actin itself can also activate some Cl channel activity.  In several cases where the effects of cytochalasin have been compared with those of nocodazole or colchicine, microtubule disruption has not been found to affect Na+, K+, or Cl channels. However, disruption of microtubules has been reported to enhance the activity of both Ca2+ (73, 218) and Cl (92, 109) channels in some cases.  An intriguing hypothesis for how disruption of actin may activate K+ channels is by release of protein kinase A (PKA) bound to the actin (175). In this model, the regulation depends not only on a link of actin to the receptor, but on changing localization of a cytoskeleton-bound signaling kinase, as discussed in section IIB.  Some Ca2+ channels are inactivated by cytochalasin, and the effect is blocked by phalloidin. However, stretch-activated Ca2+ influx can be activated by cytochalasin and inhibited by F-actin. Moreover, there are several reports of microtubule disruption also altering Ca2+ channel activity (73, 218), with a strong enhancement in one case that was not achieved by cytochalasin. A scenario derived from Reference 78 for how actin filaments may affect Ca2+ influx resulting from mechanical stresses is shown in Figure 2. In this model, application of a mechanical stress at the plasma membrane of a resting cell causes deformation of channels in the plasma membrane that results in Ca2+ influx. In these cells, a sustained mechanical stress leads to assembly of two distinct structures: contractile elements containing actin filaments that create an opposing force and an elastic network that resists subsequent application of the external stress. As the stress is transmitted to the newly formed three-dimensional cytoskeleton, it is directed away from the plasma membrane, and the deformation of membrane elements near the site of force is now insufficient to activate Ca2+ influx.   One context in which mechanical effects on the cytoskeleton regulate ion fluxes is volume regulation after osmotic stress. Although the elastic modulus of the cytoskeleton is probably too low (1,000-10,000 Pa in some cell types and lower in others) to prevent volume changes caused by osmotic imbalance (10,000 Pa/mosM), its presence as an elastic element provides the cell with a countering tension and a memory of the undeformed state, at least for the time that the cross-linked cytoskeleton remains intact. It is not surprising, therefore, that the cytoskeleton affects ion transport in volume regulation (33, 43, 92, 129, 193). Among the clearest evidence for a mechanical function comes from the finding that melanoma cells containing approximately normal amounts of cytoskeletal filaments and ion channels, but lacking the cross-linking protein ABP280 that provides rigidity to the cell cortex, fail to volume regulate under hypotonic conditions. Transfection of ABP280 to these cells restores this capacity (33).  Whether the effects of the cytoskeleton on ion channel activity are a direct mechanical effect or an indirect effect due to such changes as regulation of kinases sequestered at the cytoskeleton remains a controversial issue. There are reports that the cytoskeleton has no effect on channel activity and reports that ion conductance through channels within a lipid bilayer can be altered by bilayer dilation in the absence of any internal network (162). On the other hand, there are intriguing hypotheses that actin filaments and microtubules could directly transmit ion fluxes because of their polyelectrolyte nature and the presence of a condensed counterion cloud (133). Although such effects appear plausible from a physical-chemical perspective, demonstrating their importance in biological ion signaling remains a chal...",

The ds RNAi oligo for Daam1 reduces the protein level of Daam1, but not of RhoA, ?-catenin (Figure 3C) or Dvl2 (not shown). Importantly, the RNAi oligo inhibits RhoA activation by Wnt-1, Fz, or Dvl, but not by Ephexin (Figure 3C). A control ds RNAi oligo has no effect on Daam1 or RhoA protein level or RhoA activation (Figure 3C). Thus, Daam1 is essential for Wnt/Fz/Dvl activation of RhoA. AN ACTIVATED DAAM1 INDUCES RHO ACTIVATION IN A RHO-GEF-DEPENDENT MANNER Previous studies suggest that deletion of the amino terminal domain results in constitutive activation of FH proteins by releasing an intramolecular inhibition (Watanabe et al. 1999; Tominaga et al. 2000 and Westendorf 2001). C-Daam1 thus may represent an activated form of Daam1. Indeed, while the full length Daam1 is inactive, C-Daam1 overexpression causes activation of RhoA, but not of Rac or Cdc42 (Figure 3D). C-Daam1 activation of RhoA is not affected by ?PDZ-Dvl (Figure 3A), which inhibits RhoA activation by Fz or Dvl (Figure 1F), further demonstrating that Daam1 functions downstream of Dvl in Rho activation.",

              "summary_text": "LSC (also known as ARHGEF1) is a haematopoietic cell-restricted GEF for RHOA, which interacts with G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-associated Galpha12 and Galpha13 proteins (Fig. 5). In addition to its DH domain with GEF activity, LSC has a regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) domain, which binds to Galpha proteins and increases their intrinsic GTPase activity, thereby turning off GPCR signalling. So LSC seems to carry out two functions. First, it transduces GPCR signals from Galpha12 and Galpha13 proteins to activate RHOA and second, it attenuates other Galpha12- or Galpha13-coupled GPCR signals. In LSC-deficient mice, the number of B cells is decreased as are T cell-dependent antibody responses to protein antigens owing to a cell-intrinsic requirement for LSC in B cells27, 28. Further analysis has shown that LSC-deficient marginal zone B cells migrate more effectively in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in vitro, which might be due to the loss of LSC-mediated inhibition of signalling from Galpha12/13-coupled S1P receptors. By contrast, LSC-deficient marginal zone B cells have a defect in their ability to detach from ICAM1 and they do not migrate to the follicles following LPS stimulation in vivo. The defects in migration to the follicles might reflect a requirement for LSC-mediated RHOA activation in the disengagement of integrin binding at the trailing edge of the migrating B cell28. ",

In hypertension, Ang II via AT1 receptors induces vascular structural changes, including cell hypertrophy, accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and induction of profibrotic growth factors, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF).3 This growth factor also mediates cell proliferation/apoptosis, migration, cellular adhesion, wound healing, and angiogenesis.4 CTGF overexpression has been found in human atherosclerotic and myocardial lesions as well as in the aorta of Ang II–infused rats, associated with ECM accumulation. In VSMCs, CTGF acts as a downstream mediator of Ang II–induced fibrosis. The AT1 are G-coupled receptors that activate several intracellular signaling systems, such as protein kinases (MAPK and Rho kinase [ROCK]), small G proteins, including Ras, Rac1 and RhoA, transcription factors (AP-1, Smads), and redox process, which regulate several Ang II–mediated responses.  In VSMCs, statins inhibited Ang II-induced Rho membrane localization and activation. In these cells Ang II regulated CTGF via RhoA/Rho kinase activation, as shown by inhibition of Rho with C3 exoenzyme, RhoA dominant-negative overexpression, and Rho kinase inhibition. ",

Throughout interphase, human Myt1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, whereas Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here we report that overproduction of either kinase-active or kinase-inactive forms of Myt1 blocked the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of cyclin B1 and caused cells to delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The COOH-terminal 63 amino acids of Myt1 were identified as a Cdc2-cyclin B1 interaction domain. Myt1 mutants lacking this domain no longer bound cyclin B1 and did not efficiently phosphorylate Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes in vitro. In addition, cells overproducing mutant forms of Myt1 lacking the interaction domain exhibited normal trafficking of cyclin B1 and unperturbed cell cycle progression. These results suggest that the docking of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes to the COOH terminus of Myt1 facilitates the phosphorylation of Cdc2 by Myt1 and that overproduction of Myt1 perturbs cell cycle progression by sequestering Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes in the cytoplasm.",

Phosphorylations of Cdks are facilitated by Cyclin binding and stabilize the Cyclin:Cdk complex (Jackman and Pines, 1997). Human Myt1 phosphorylates and inactivates Cdk1 associated with cyclins A and B but does not phosphorylate Cdk2 or Cdk4 complexes (Booher et al., 1997) (unlike wee1, which can phosphorylate both Cdk1 and Cdk2). Myt1 is membrane bound to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex. Phosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 occurs when the cycB:Cdk1 complex assembles in the cytoplasm (Pines and Hunter, 1994). Wee1, however, is in the nucleus; hence another kinase may be operating in the cytoplasm (Matsuura and Wang, 1996). Thr14 phosphorylation precedes Tyr15 phosphorylation (Liu et al., 1997).",

Upon growth factor stimulation, Akt is activated, directly phosphorylating FKHRL1 at T32 and S253, and to a lesser extent at S315, and resulting in FKHRL1 relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ....  Similar AKT-dependent changes in subcellular localization have also been observed for the additional FKHRL1 human homologs AFX and FKHR.... Phosphorylation at T32 and S253 causes FKHRL1 to bind to 14-3-3, suggesting that the interaction between FKHRL1 and 14-3-3 may play an important role in regulating the subcellular localization of the complex.",

Activation of the kinase requires hierarchical phosphorylation at multiple sites, culminating in the phosphorylation of the threonine in position 229 (Thr229), in the catalytic domain. The homologous site in protein kinase B (PKB), Thr308, has been shown to be phosphorylated by the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1. A regulatory link between p70s6k and PKB was demonstrated, as PDK1 was found to selectively phosphorylate p70s6k at Thr229. More importantly, PDK1 activated p70s6k in vitro and in vivo, whereas the catalytically inactive PDK1 blocked insulin-induced activation of p70s6k.",

This results in inhibition of Akt activation (pAkt), which may be involved in the growth inhibitory responses seen with PPAR? activation. Decreased Akt activity also can lead to decreased activity of the transcription factor NF-?B. NF-?B is a critical transcription factor in the production of proangiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, IL-8. Decreased production of these factors would be expected to inhibit recruitment of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, and block tumor angiogenesis. PPAR?-mediated suppression of members of the Snail family of transcription factors, such as Snail, Zeb, or Twist, would lead to derepression of E-cadherin expression and promote the epithelial phenotype, leading to decreased migration and invasiveness. PPAR?-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression in NSCLC has been shown by several investigators. This would result in decreased PGE2 production, which will impact growth. TZDs can inhibit PGE2 production through a PPAR?-independent pathway involving induction of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). (Figure 2 full text)",

Polyhistidine-tagged Akt or dominant-negative mutant Akt (dnAkt)-transfected clones were generated from HPL-V12 cells. The success of the gene transfections was confirmed by Western blotting for Akt and the polyhistidine tag (His) (Figure 3a) . The dnAkt-transfected HPL-V12 cells (V12/dnAkt) showed significant reductions of the autonomous migration by about 50% compared to the mock-transfected HPL-V12 cells (V12/Emp), while Akt-transfected HPL-V12 cells (V12/Akt) showed increased levels of migration compared to V12/Emp cells ",

For example, integrin- airlinked kinase (ILK) activation is inhibited by blockade of Akt function (Persad et al., 2000), and PTEN interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and influences cell migration (Tamura et al., 1999). These interactions affect cell survival, an event influenced by both VEGF and integrins. Also, cell migration and angiogenesis are reg- ulated by Akt and PTEN, and these cellular responses are clearly mediated by integrins (Jiang et al., 2000). By overexpression approaches, we have directly impli- cated Akt and PTEN in the pathway from VEGF to integ- rin activation. Thus, some of the functions of PI 3-kinase, Akt, and PTEN in cell migration may depend upon their role in integrin activation, and engagement of VEGFR2",

To further define the pathways by which FGFs activate Elf5 expression, we cultured E11.5 lung tips in the presence of compounds to inhibit FGF receptors (SU5402), PI3-Kinase/Akt-mediated signaling (LY294002), and MAP Kinase/Erk-mediated signaling (U0126). We found that SU5402 and LY294002 significantly reduced Elf5 expression, whereas U0126 had no effect. LY294002 also reduced Elf5 expression in cultures of purified epithelium. Finally, pAkt was coexpressed with Elf5 in the proximal epithelial airways of E17.5 lungs. These results demonstrate that Elf5 is an FGF-sensitive transcription factor in the lung with a dynamic pattern of expression and that FGF regulation of Elf5 by means of FGFR2b occurs through the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway.",

Thus PI3K, PDK, PKB and GSK3 constitute one important arm of the insulin signalling cascade regulating glycogen synthesis. In addition to inducing an increase in glucose transport, over-expression of PKB elicited an inhibition of GSK3 and a concomitant increase in glycogen and protein synthesis a decrease in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, glucose transport and membrane ruffling, which coincided with reduced phosphorylation of PKB and p70S6K but normal phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK observed an inhibition of PKB phosphorylation and downstream p70S6K activation, which was attributable to a PP2A-type phosphatase activity Akt phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3, decreasing the rate of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase",

This leads to the autophosphorylation of Kit on tyrosine and its association with substrates of various kinds. The phophatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt system is one of the major pathways [33] (fig. 1). PI3K is composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. The 85-kDa regulatory subunit is associated with activated Kit through an SH2 domain, and then is phosphorylated on tyrosine. The 110-kDa catalytic subunit of the activated PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, which in turn is used for phosphorylation of Akt, a serine-threonine kinase. The activated Akt is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis of cells whose survival depends on Kit signaling. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate blocks not only autophosphorylation of Kit but also phosphorylation of Akt [34]. Induction of apoptosis in Kit signaling-dependent cells by imatinib mesylate may be mediated through the inhibition of Akt activity.",

Because FAK binds PI 3-kinase, the protective effect against anoikis may be the result of PI 3-kinase-mediated activation of protein kinase B/Akt (52). Akt promotes survival, at least in part, by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating two proapoptotic proteins, Bad and caspase-9 (53) (Fig. 4). Inhibition of p53 prevents FAKdeficient cells from undergoing anoikis when deprived of growth factors, suggesting that p53 mediates the death signal under FAK deficiency (51).",

Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

              "summary_text": "Interestingly, the presence of two additional basic amino acids 6 and 7 residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation site in certain peptide substrates allows phosphorylation by CaMKI/IV equally well with or without activation by a CaMKK (14). This \\\"activation independence\\\" has not yet been demonstrated toward protein substrates. Nonetheless, because CaMKI/IV requires Ca2+/CaM for deinhibition in addition to activation loop phosphorylation, substrates of this type would not be phosphorylated by CaMKI/IV until a Ca2+ signal was initiated and so could represent Ca2+-dependent but activation-independent signaling targets. Subsequent activation by a CaMKK would increase the number of available substrates by enhancing CaMKI/IV activity toward a second set of substrates (Fig. 1).   Does the Cascade Function in Cells? TOP INTRODUCTION Identification and Biochemical... Does the Cascade Function... Is the Cascade Physiologic? Other Transcriptional Targets... Evidence for a CaMK... REFERENCES  The first reconstruction of a CaMK cascade in cells used transient transfection experiments with CREB as the transcriptional target. CaMKI and CaMKIV phosphorylate CREB on its activating Ser-133 in vitro and stimulate Gal4-CREB-dependent transcription in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ when cells are cotransfected with Gal4-CREB and a Gal4 reporter gene (15). Additional cotransfection with a CaMKK increases reporter activity more than 10-fold (8, 9). Mutation of the CaMKIV activation loop T to A abolishes CaMKK enhancement.  To be a signaling cascade, kinase activation loop phosphorylation must be dependent upon induction of CaMKK activity. Phosphate incorporation into endogenous CaMKIV in Jurkat cells is induced rapidly following T-cell receptor stimulation and is blocked by chelation of extracellular Ca2+. This is accompanied by 8-14-fold increases in immunoprecipitated CaMKIV activity that is refractory to further activation by exogenous CaMKK and can be reversed by in vitro treatment with PP2A (16). Recombinant CaMKIV transfected into BJAB cells, which lack endogenous CaMKIV, demonstrates similar activation following anti-IgM stimulation that is abrogated by mutating the activation loop T to A (4). Likewise, CaMKI phosphorylation is induced in PC12 cells, coincident with increased CaMKI activity and reduced activation of CaMKI by exogenous CaMKK (17). Collectively, these experiments provide strong evidence for an inducible, Ca2+-dependent activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV in intact cells via activation loop phosphorylation. However, the fact that activation loop phosphorylation requires Ca2+ does not confirm that the physiologic activator is itself Ca2+-dependent, because Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKI or CaMKIV is required before these enzymes can be phosphorylated by the known CaMKKs.  The issue of subcellular localization is a confounding one for any model of the CaMK cascade regulating transcription. There are several lines of evidence that CaMKK and - are both cytoplasmic. In contrast to an early study using a polyclonal antibody, immunohistochemistry of rat brain slices using monoclonal antibodies able to distinguish between the  and  isoforms found exclusively cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for both (18). Furthermore, green fluorescent protein-tagged CaMKK and - are cytoplasmic in NG108 cells even after depolarizing stimulation (18). This holds true for overexpressed CaMKK in Jurkat and BJAB cells.2 Similarly, CaMKI appears to be excluded from the nucleus in brain slices as well as in cells overexpressing the protein, yet CaMKI immunoreactivity has recently been observed to translocate to the nuclei of hippocampal neurons during long term potentiation (19, 20).3 In contrast, CaMKIV is predominantly nuclear but can also be found in neuronal soma and dendritic processes, where it could interact with a cytoplasmic CaMKK (21).  The CaMK cascade then is well positioned to affect cytoplasmic e...",

These results indicate that SIN1 is not essential for Akt Thr308 phosphorylation and that the Ser473 phosphorylation is not a prerequisite for Thr308 phosphorylation. Akt, Singly Phosphorylated at Thr308, Remains Active and Functional in Response to Growth Factor Stimulation in SIN1-/- Cells Since Akt Thr308 phosphorylation was not dependent on Ser473 phosphorylation in SIN1-/- cells, we then asked whether this Thr308 singly phosphorylated Akt is still active and whether lack of Ser473 phosphorylation would have a global effect on the phosphorylation of Akt targets. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that Akt retained a substantial amount of enzymatic activity in SIN1-/- cells, although lower than that in wild-type cells (Figure 3B). Thus, singly phosphorylated (Thr308) Akt is an active but weaker enzyme.",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

First, is the presence of a p53 RE in the DNA close to the gene or within the gene. Second, is to demonstrate that the particular gene is upregulated or downregulated at the RNA and protein level by wild-type p53 protein. The third line of evidence is to clone the RE upstream of any reporter gene like luciferase and show that p53 induction can regulate this test gene in the same fashion as the gene of interest. Finally, it has to be established by ChIP using specific p53 antibody, that p53 physically interacts with the RE and binds to the chromatin. In some cases a gel-shift assay is also done additionally to demonstrate the binding in vitro. Here, in this study we have fulfilled all the above criteria and have established the SAC gene Cdc20 to be downregulated by p53 upon DNA damage where activated p53 directly binds to the RE located 689-bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS).",

              "summary_text": "The p53 TSG serves as a major cellular barrier against cancer development by way of apoptosis induction. P53 gene mutations and/or protein accumulation are the most common genetic changes in human tumors [88,  89]. The p53 gene is frequently inactivated by loss of heterozygosity (LOH), missense mutations and frameshift deletions, and in addition to the loss of wild-type p53, a high percentage of tumor cells accumulate mutant P53 protein isoforms [12,  88]. Whilst wild-type P53 functions as a tumor-suppressor, tumor-associated P53 proteins acquire novel functions enabling them to regulate gene expression and promote a large spectrum of cancer phenotypes [88]. P53 gene mutations are more frequent in intestinal than in diffuse type tumors, and alterations have been reported to occur at the premalignant stages of dysplasia and IM. Thus, p53 mutations have a crucial and early role in gastric carcinogenesis of the intestinal type; an immunohistochemical and genetic analysis revealed that early tumors with the poorest prognosis (i.e. that deeply penetrated the submucosa), showed the highest frequency of both p53 gene mutation and of nonmutated protein accumulation. However, p53 mutations and nuclear accumulation are late events in diffuse-type GC [89]. P53 belongs to a small family of sequence-specific nuclear transcription factors, to which p63 and p73 also belong [90]. P53 and P73 share structural and functional similarities; both are potent tumor suppressors with different isoforms that accumulate in response to DNA damage and have altered functions which often oppose those of the wild-type. Isoforms of P73 can inhibit both p53 and p73, thus assisting in tumor progression in contrast to the wild-type role of tumor suppression. In the absence of functional p53, p73 can be responsible for regulating the cell cycle, promoting apoptotic cell death in tumor cells and regulating the response of tumor cells to drugs; however, the regulatory mechanisms of the pro-apoptotic activity of p73 are distinct from those used by p53. The complexity of p73?s activity results in contradiction in its role as an important member of the p53 TSG family, thus further investigations are needed to fully verify its role in cancer [90,  91]. The Puma protein (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis) belongs to the BH3-only group of proteins along with Bcl-2. It is a potent mediator of the p53 apoptotic response that dimerizes with other BH3-only proteins resulting in release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria and induction of apoptosis by the activation of caspases 3 and 9 [84]. However, Puma expression is transactivated by p53 and p73 and its expression is increased in gastric carcinomas whilst remaining absent in normal gastric mucosa, suggesting it may have a potential oncogenic role and could possibly be used as a diagnostic marker [92].",

From results: Of ?40,000 human transcripts represented on the chip, 143 genes (166 probe sets) were found differentially expressed in HCT116 cells treated with nutlin-3a (Fig. 1D and Table 1, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The list included multiple genes previously shown to be affected by p53 activation (19?21), including 32 transcripts reported as directly regulated by p53. Changes in the expression of many genes may reflect the altered cell-cycle distribution in cells that arrest predominantly in G1 and G2 phases as a result of p53 activation (12). With the exception of a few genes that were marginally down-regulated in HCT116 cells, the inactive enantiomer did not significantly change the gene expression profile of both cell lines. Taken together, the data in Fig. 1 indicate that nutlin-3a is a highly selective MDM2 antagonist and p53 inducer. *Differential expression was determined as 3-fold altered in HCT116 treated with nutlin-3a vs. vehicle and P < 0.05, and no change (<1.5-fold change) in the H1299 cells or HCT116 treated with nutlin-3b. **Expression vaules are the average of three replicates of Affymetrix MAS5 signal intensities scaled to the median of the experiment.  P value calculations are a simple t test P value of the null hypothesis of no difference between nutlin-3a treated samples vs. DMSO-treated samples.",

We observed that rAd-p53 can induce apoptosis in both 2774 and 2774qw1 cells but not in 2774qw2 cells. Surprisingly, overexpression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) also triggered apoptosis within these two cell lines. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the differential expression of BAX, BCL2, and caspase 3 genes, specific in rAd-p53-induced apoptotic cells, was not altered in rAd-p21-induced apoptotic cells, suggesting p21(WAF1/CIP1)-induced apoptosis through a pathway distinguishable from p53-induced apoptosis. Expression analysis of 2774qw1 cells infected with rAd-p21 on 60,000 cDNA microarrays identified 159 genes in response to p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in at least one time point with 2.5-fold change as a cutoff. Integration of the data with the parallel microarray experiments with rAd-p53 infection allowed us to extract 66 genes downstream of both p53 and p21(WAF1/CIP1) and 93 genes in response to p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in a p53-independent pathway. The genes in the former set may play a dual role in both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways, and the genes in the latter set gave a mechanistic molecular explanation for p53-independent p21(WAF1/CIP1)-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, promoter sequence analysis suggested that transcription factor E2F family is partially responsible for the differential expression of genes following p21(WAF1/CIP1). This study has profound significance toward understanding the role of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in p53-independent apoptosis.",

One theory is that these phenotypes are caused by novel transcriptional regulatory events acquired by mutant p53s. Another explanation is that these effects are a result of an imbalance of functions caused by the retention of some of the wild-type transcriptional regulatory events in the context of a loss of other counterbalancing activities. An analysis of the ability of DNA-binding domain mutants A138P and R175H, and wild-type p53 to regulate the expression levels of 6.9 x 10(3) genes revealed that the mutants retained only wild-type protein. A138P p53 exhibited mostly retained wild-type regulatory activities and few acquired novel events. However, R175H p53 possessed an approximately equal number of wild-type regulatory events and novel activities. This is the first report that, after examination of the regulation of a large unfocused set of genes, provides data indicating that remaining wild-type transcriptional regulatory functions existing in the absence of counterbalancing activities as well as acquired novel events both contribute to the gain-of-function phenotypes produced by mutant p53s. However, mutant p53s are likely to be distinct in terms of the extent to which each mechanism contributes to their gain-of-function phenotypes.",

Expression of p53 induces either a stable growth arrest or programmed cell death (apoptosis). In human colorectal cancers, the growth arrest is dependent on the transcriptional induction of the protein p21WAF1/CIP1 , but the mechanisms underlying the development of p53-dependent apoptosis are largely unknown. As the most well documented biochemical property of p53 is its ability to activate transcription of genes, we examined in detail the transcripts induced by p53 expression before the onset of apoptosis. Of 7,202 transcripts identified, only 14 (0.19%) were found to be markedly increased in p53-expressing cells compared with control cells. Strikingly, many of these genes were predicted to encode proteins that could generate or respond to oxidative stress, including one that is implicated in apoptosis in plant meristems. These observations stimulated additional biochemical and pharmacological experiments suggesting that p53 results in apoptosis through a three-step process: (1) the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes; (2) the formation of reactive oxygen species; and (3) the oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components, culminating in cell death.",

AGF mutation in the phosphorylation site of the kinase.9 This mutant prevents hypoxia-induced activation of endogenous p38alpha MAPK.4 We predicted that inactivating p38alpha MAPK would diminish the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of p53. Accordingly, little p-p53(S15) was observed in the presence of p38alphaDN during H/R, corrected for modest change in total p53 protein concentration (Figure 2). Similarly, the use of a chemical inhibitor of p38alpha MAPK, SB203580 (SB), also attenuated p-p53(S15). Although SB inhibits both p38alpha and p38beta MAPKs, the latter is not activated by H/R stress alone, whereas the former is significantly up-regulated by the same stimulus.4 Therefore, SB is likely to inhibit p38alpha MAPK to a much greater degree than p38beta in H/R. Overall, these results indicate that H/R-induced p53 depends on p38alpha MAPK. ",

We show that the mdr1 promoter (-1165 to +84) is able to activate the expression of a reporter gene in response to 3-MC in Hepa-1c1c7 but not in BP(r)c1 cells. Deletion analysis indicated that the region from -245 to -141 contains cis-acting sequences mediating the induction, including a potential p53 binding sequence. 3-MC treatment of the cells increased the levels of p53 and induced p53 binding to the mdr1 promoter in an AhR.Arnt-dependent manner. Mutations in the p53 binding site abrogated induction of mdr1 by 3-MC, indicating that p53 binding to the mdr1 promoter is essential for the induction.",

Both advantages may be overcome by antiangiogenic therapy. Tumor cells with p53 mutations may become resistant to apoptosis [55], and thus decrease their response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. In mice, p53 mutations may also decrease the response of cancer cells to antiangiogenic therapies [56]. Wild-type p53 normally suppresses tumor angiogenesis by up-regulating thrombospondin-1 [57], inducing degradation of HIF-1-alpha [58], suppressing transcription of VEGF [59] and down-regulating bFGF-binding protein expression [60].",

Ectopically expressed p53AIP1, which is localized within mitochondria, leads to apoptotic cell death through dissipation of mitochondrial A(psi)m. We have found that upon severe DNA damage, Ser-46 on p53 is phosphorylated and apoptosis is induced. In addition, substitution of Ser-46 inhibits the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis and selectively blocks expression of p53AIP1. Our results suggest that p53AIP1 is likely to play an important role in mediating p53-dependent apoptosis, and phosphorylation of Ser-46 regulates the transcriptional activation of this apoptosis-inducing gene.",

              "summary_text": "Here we show that genotoxic stress promotes the p53-dependent up-regulation of the homologous miRNAs miR-192 and miR-215. Like miR-34a, activation of miR-192/215 induces cell cycle arrest, suggesting that multiple miRNA families operate in the p53 network. Furthermore, we define a downstream gene expression signature for miR-192/215 expression, which includes a number of transcripts that regulate G(1) and G(2) checkpoints. Of these transcripts, 18 transcripts are direct targets of miR-192/215, and the observed cell cycle arrest likely results from a cooperative effect among the modulations of these genes by the miRNAs. miR-192 and miR-215 generate a gene expression signature that is enriched for regulators of cell cycle progression. Microarray profiling of miR-192– and miR-215–regulated transcripts. HCT116 DICERex5 cells were transfected with luciferase siRNA (Luc siRNA) or miR-192 or miR-215 synthetic duplexes. RNA was isolated at 10 and 24 h following transfection and was compared with RNA isolated from mock-transfected cells.",

It can induce cell death by stabilizing the levels of p53 through activating the ARF tumor suppressor, which suppresses Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53. The p53 protein regulates the transcription of several celldeath genes including BH3-only proteins, proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax and the caspase-9 adaptor Apaf-1. In cells lacking p53, E2F-1 can act through p73, a member of p53 family that activates some of the same target genes as p53. E2F-1 can also directly regulate the transcription of several different caspases and suppress cell survival pathways by suppressing Mcl-1 expression or by inhibiting NFkB-mediated antiapoptotic signaling.",

Previous studies have shown that overexpression of wild-type p53 leads to apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. DNA damage, such as that caused by UV irradiation, results in p53 stabilization and nuclear localization that subsequently induces apoptosis. Recently, the level of calreticulin (CRT) has been correlated with the rate of apoptosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of CRT in the regulation of apoptosis via modulating p53 function and expression. Here we show a significant decrease in both basal and DNA damage induced p53 functions in the CRT-deficient cells (crt-/-). This study is the first to demonstrate that CRT function is required for the stability and localization of the p53 protein. By using immuonocytochemical techniques, we showed that observed changes in p53 in the crt-/- cells are due to the nuclear accumulation of Mdm2 (murine double minute gene). These results, lead us to conclude that CRT regulates p53 function by affecting its rate of degradation and nuclear localization.",

Stabilization of p53 is crucial for its tumour suppressor function. However, the precise mechanism by which ubiquitinated p53 levels are regulated in vivo is not completely understood. By mass spectrometry of affinity-purified p53-associated factors, we have identified herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) as a novel p53-interacting protein. HAUSP strongly stabilizes p53 even in the presence of excess Mdm2, and also induces p53-dependent cell growth repression and apoptosis. Significantly, HAUSP has an intrinsic enzymatic activity that specifically deubiquitinates p53 both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive point mutant of HAUSP in cells increases the levels of p53 ubiquitination and destabilizes p53. These findings reveal an important mechanism by which p53 can be stabilized by direct deubiquitination and also imply that HAUSP might function as a tumour suppressor in vivo through the stabilization of p53.",

We identified a large and essentially late H(2)O(2) response of induced and repressed genes that unexpectedly comprise few or no antioxidants but mostly apoptosis and cell cycle control activities. The requirement of the p53 regulator for regulating about a third of this H(2)O(2) stimulon and the lack of an associated enhancement of total cellular H(2)O(2) scavenging activity further suggest that H(2)O(2) elicits a stress antiproliferative/repair response that does not increase antioxidant defenses. We conclude that mammalian antioxidant defenses are constitutive, a finding that contrasts with the oxidant-inducibility of such defenses in microorganisms. This finding might be important in understanding the role of H(2)O(2) as a key signaling molecule in mammals.",

MDM2 inhibits the acetylation of p53 by p300/CBP through a mechanism that requires a stable p53-MDM2 interaction and that is sensitive to the deacetylase inhibitor, TSA. MDMX is an MDM2-like protein that shares with MDM2 the ability to interact with p53 and, in turn, inhibit p53-mediated transcription. It was therefore of interest to determine if MDMX could also inhibit the acetylation of p53 by p300/CBP. We demonstrate that MDMX dramatically inhibits the acetylation of p53 induced by both endogenous and ectopically expressed p300/CBP. We also demonstrate that the p53-binding domain of MDMX is required for the MDMX-mediated inhibition of p53 acetylation. Our results indicate that MDMX shares with MDM2 the ability to regulate a potentially important post-translational modification of p53. These results may have important biologic implications with respect to the MDMX-mediated regulation of p53 activity during development.",

Glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) and thioredoxin reductase (TR), the most abundant antioxidant selenium-containing proteins in mammals, have been implicated in this protection. We analyzed the expression of TR and GPX1 in the following model cancer systems: (1) liver tumors in TGFalpha/c-myc transgenic mice; (2) human prostate cell lines from normal and cancer tissues; and (3) p53-induced apoptosis in a human colon cancer cell line. TR was induced while GPX1 was repressed in malignancies relative to controls in transgenic mice and prostate cell lines. In the colon cell line, p53 expression resulted in elevated GPX1, but repressed TR. The data indicate that TR and GPX1 are regulated in a contrasting manner in the cancer systems tested and reveal the p53-dependent regulation of selenoprotein expression. The data suggest that additional studies on selenoprotein regulation in different cancers are required to evaluate future implementation of selenium as a dietary supplement in individuals at risk for developing certain cancers.",

We show here that the protein product of the gene hSIR2(SIRT1), the human homolog of the S. cerevisiae Sir2 protein known to be involved in cell aging and in the response to DNA damage, binds and deacetylates the p53 protein with a specificity for its C-terminal Lys382 residue, modification of which has been implicated in the activation of p53 as a transcription factor. Expression of wild-type hSir2 in human cells reduces the transcriptional activity of p53. In contrast, expression of a catalytically inactive hSir2 protein potentiates p53-dependent apoptosis and radiosensitivity. We propose that hSir2 is involved in the regulation of p53 function via deacetylation.",

While loss of p53 alone is sufficient to circumvent NPM-ALK-induced senescence and permit cellular transformation, sole loss of Rb permits continued proliferation but not transformation due to p53-imposed restraints. Furthermore, NPM-ALK attenuates p53 activity in an Rb and MDM2 dependent manner but this activity is not sufficient to bypass senescence. ",

We have identified E2F consensus sites in the promoter region, whereas p53 recognition sequences were found in intron1. Sequence analysis has shown that these consensus sites are also conserved between mouse and human SIVA genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal that both transcription factors are capable of binding to putative consensus sites, and luciferase reporter assays reveal that E2F1 and p53 can activate transcription from the SIVA promoter.

RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and",

              "summary_text": "The best studied oncogenic mechanisms are inactivating defects in both alleles of tumor suppressor genes and activating mutations in oncogenes. Chromosomal gains and losses are frequent in human tumors, but for many regions, like 1p36 and 17q in neuroblastoma, no mutated tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes were identified. Amplification of N-myc in neuroblastoma is strongly correlated with loss of 1p36 and gain of 17q. Here we report that N-myc down-regulates the mRNA expression of many genes with a role in cell architecture. One of them is the 1p36 gene Cdc42. Restoring the Cdc42 expression in neuroblastoma cells strongly induced differentiation. N-myc also inhibited Cdc42 functioning at the protein level. This was mediated by nm23-H1 and nm23-H2, which are located in the amplified 17q region. Nm23-H1 and nm23-H2 are strongly up-regulated downstream targets of N-myc. Nm23-H1 was shown to bind Cdc42 and prevented the induction of differentiation. Overexpression of Nm23 due to gain of 17q and induction by N-myc combined with weak expression of Cdc42 due to loss of 1p36 and down-regulation by N-myc can thus block differentiation. Although this marks Cdc42 as a candidate tumor suppressor gene, no mutations were found. Further silencing of Cdc42 by small interfering RNA induced massive apoptosis, indicating that tumor cell survival requires a minimal Cdc42 activity. Three regions of chromosomal gain and loss thus affect genes functioning in one pathway in neuroblastoma. They converge to bring the pathway out of balance and prevent Cdc42 mediated differentiation.",

              "summary_text": "These findings suggest that different signal transduction pathways as well as cell cycle-specific regulation are controlling the phosphorylation of Ser-62. Indeed RAS signaling that results in the activation of MAP kinases has been suggested to enhance MYC phosphorylation at Ser-62 (31, 32). Phosphorylation at this site appears to affect the stability of MYC at the G0 to G1 transition and to regulate MYC DNA binding (see below). Together these findings promote an attractive model because the RAS signaling pathway is activated by many growth factors and coincides with a strong increase in MYC protein levels upon reentry of cells into the cell cycle. However, because the evidence was derived from cells that overexpressed MYC from recombinant adenoviruses (31, 32), some caution is indicated. The massive overexpression of MYC in resting cells should stimulate cell cycle entry and apoptosis. Also it is not clear whether enough MAXis present in cells to build faithful MYC/MAX complexes. These artificial conditions may severely affect protein behavior, including stability and the response to RAS signaling. It should also be considered that MYC mRNA expression is strongly enhanced upon growth factor treatment of resting cells (6), and the analysis of de novo MYC protein synthesis has revealed a substantial increase in different cell types, including primary cells (33, 34). Thus the contribution of RAS signaling to MYC expression levels at the G0 to G1 transition will need further studying. It should also be noted that the role of MAPK in phosphorylating Ser-62 has been disputed (29). Once Ser-62 is phosphorylated, Thr-58 of MYC becomes a substrate for GSK3 (24). Most substrates of this enzyme must first be phosphorylated by another kinase at a Ser or Thr amino acid four residues C-terminal of the GSK3 site (35). This \\\"priming phosphate\\\" binds specifically into a pocket of the substrate recognition domain of GSK3 and explains why MYC and other substrates require this phosphorylation for the precise positioning of the phosphorylation site. Thus phosphorylation of Thr-58 appears to be strictly dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser-62. Similar findings were made for MYCN (36). Phosphorylation at Ser-54 by CDK1 leads to Thr-50 phosphorylation by GSK3, the two sites correspond to Ser-62 and Thr-58 in MYC, respectively, which enhances MYCN turnover during mitosis in neuronal cells.",

The identification of N-myc target genes is an important step for understanding N-Myc biological functions in both physiological and pathological contexts. In this study, we describe the identification of N-Myc-responsive genes through chromatin immunoprecipitation and methylation-sensitive restriction analysis. Results show that N-Myc is a direct regulator of several identified genes, and that methylation of the CpG dinucleotide within the E-box prevents the access of N-Myc to gene promoters in vivo. Furthermore, methylation profile of the E-box within the promoters of EGFR and CASP8, two genes directly controlled by Myc, is cell type-specific, suggesting that differential E-box methylation may contribute to generating unique patterns of Myc-dependent transcription. This study illuminates a central role of DNA methylation in controlling N-Myc occupancy at gene promoters and modulating its transcriptional activity in cancer cells.",

Here we present the characterization of a domain conserved in c-, N-, and L-Myc from fish to humans, N-Myc317-337, designated Myc box IV (MBIV). A deletion of this domain leads to a defect in Myc-induced apoptosis and in some transformation assays but not in cell proliferation. Unlike other Myc mutants, MycDeltaMBIV is not a simple loss-of-function mutant because it is hyperactive for G2 arrest in primary cells. Microarray analysis of genes regulated by N-MycDeltaMBIV reveals that it is weakened for transactivation and repression but not nearly as defective as N-MycDeltaMBII. Although the mutated region is not part of the previously defined DNA binding domain, we find that N-MycDeltaMBIV has a significantly lower affinity for DNA than the wild-type protein in vitro. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation shows reduced binding of N-MycDeltaMBIV to some target genes in vivo, which correlates with the defect in transactivation. Thus, this conserved domain has an unexpected role in Myc DNA binding activity. These data also provide a novel separation of Myc functions linked to the modulation of DNA binding activity.",

Lung level of SIRT1 is reduced in response to CS or oxidative/carbonyl stress, which leads to acetylation and degradation of FOXO3 and culminates in stress-induced premature senescence. The senescence of lung cells is a contributing factor to airspace enlargement and emphysema. NF-kB is also acetylated and activated in response to CS exposure as a result of SIRT1 reduction. However, inhibition of NF-kB-dependent lung inflammation does not prevent the progression of airspace enlargement. SIRT1 activation by overexpression and pharmacological means protects the lungs against cellular senescence and emphysematous changes.",

RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and",

Ubiquitinylation of p27 requires its phosphorylation at Thr 187 (refs 3, 4) and subsequent recognition by S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2; refs 5-8), a member of the F-box family of proteins that associates with Skp1, Cul-1 and ROC1/Rbx1 to form an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. However, in vitro ligation of p27 to ubiquitin could not be reconstituted by known purified components of the SCFSkp2 complex. Here we show that the missing factor is CDK subunit 1 (Cks1), which belongs to the highly conserved Suc1/Cks family of proteins that bind to some CDKs and phosphorylated proteins and are essential for cell-cycle progression. Human Cks1, but not other members of the family, reconstitutes ubiquitin ligation of p27 in a completely purified system, binds to Skp2 and greatly increases binding of T187-phosphorylated p27 to Skp2. Our results represent the first evidence that an SCF complex requires an accessory protein for activity as well as for binding to its phosphorylated substrate.",

Here, we discuss interconnecting signaling pathways controlled by RB and p53, attempting to explain their potentially universal involvement in the etiology of cancer.

We have recently purified an E3 enzyme, designated KIP1 ubiquitylation-promoting complex (KPC), that interacts with, and ubiquitylates, p27 in G1 phase and is localized to the cytoplasm of mammalian cells42. KPC consists of two subunits, KPC1 and KPC2. KPC1 contains a RING-finger domain near its C terminus, and functions as the catalytic subunit43. KPC2 is a member of the UBL UBA family of proteins. KPC2 stabilizes KPC1, recruits polyubiquitylated p27 and interacts with the 26S proteasome, thereby promoting the degradation of p27 (REF. 44).",
