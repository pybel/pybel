      "description": "The Endothelial Innate Immune Activation network depicts the causal mechanisms that describe acute response of healthy pulmonary endothelium to pro-inflammatory stimuli. These response mechanisms include production of the inflammatory chemokines, adhesion molecules and other mediators during endothelial cells activation leading to lung microvascular endothelial cells dysfunction. The network also includes causal mechanisms associated with angiogenic regulation by immune cells, including drivers of VEGF secretion and other related signaling pathways that crosstalk between the immune system and angiogenesis.",

      "boundary_conditions": "The human model sets represent early COPD (GOLD stage I and II) processes. If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

In accordance with the proposed activity as a scavenger receptor CXCR7-dependent chemokine degradation does not become saturated with increasing ligand concentrations.

As shown in Figure 5, wortmannin used at nanomolar concentrations specific for PI 3-kinase inhibition (Arcaro and Wymann, 1993), reduced the human endothelial cells migration induced by VEGF-A165. To determine whether beta3 integrin interferes in PI 3-kinase activation occurring after VEGFR-2 stimulation, we evaluated the effect of BV4 (anti-beta3 subunit mAb) on the phosphorylation in tyrosine residues of the p85 subunit and on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. After pre-incubation with BV4 or with anti-VEGFR-2 Ab for 20 min at 4°C, cells were stimulated with VEGF-A165. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 mAb, and the separated proteins by SDS–PAGE were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. VEGF-A165 increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of p85, but it failed to phosphorylate the PI 3-kinase subunit when endothelial cells were pre-incubated with anti-beta3 or anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies (Figure 6).",

              "summary_text": "In transgenic mice in which the large T-antigen was expressed in all -cells of the pancreatic islets, carcinomas appeared at approximately 4 weeks of life and the angiogenic switch occurred at approximately 7 weeks in 4-10% of islets [8,9]. The angiogenic switch occurred slightly later in fibrosarcomas arising in transgenic mice carrying the bovine papilloma virus oncogenes [10], or when squamous cell carcinomas arose in mice carrying the human papillovirus type 16 oncogenes targeted to basal cells of the epidermis [11]. The spontaneous angiogenic switch [9] in human tumors can be driven by: (1) angiogenic oncogenes [12] which up-regulate expression of pro-angiogenic proteins (i.e. VEGF, bFGF etc.), and/or down-regulate expression of angiogenesis inhibitors, such as thrombospondin); (2) tumor-associated hypoxic conditions which activate hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [13], which itself up-regulates angiogenic proteins; (3) fibroblasts in the tumor bed which can be induced by tumor cells to elaborate pro-angiogenic proteins [14]; and (4) bone marrow derived progenitor endothelial cells which traffic to tumors [15]. Of interest is that not all cells in a non-angiogenic dormant human tumor must switch to the angiogenic phenotype for a tumor itself to become neovascularized. Experiments in which human cancer cells both non-angiogenic and angiogenic, are mixed at different ratios before implantation into SCID immunodeficient mice reveal that as few as 1% angiogenic cells will lead to a neovascularized tumor [7]. However, the latent period before a detectable tumor appears is longer with a lower percentage of angiogenic cells (e.g. months with 1% angiogenic cells versus weeks with 50% angiogenic cells). While pre-existing microvessels, are surrounded by normal cells, under some conditions such as in brain metastasis, tumor cells can displace normal cells around a microvessel, a process of vessel cooption [16]. However, new tissue mass requires the recruitment of new microvessels. This principle applies to tumors as well as to normal tissue (such as fat) [17]. Neoplastic tissue usually exceeds the oxygen diffusion limit when tumor cell layers accumulate to a thickness of approximately 150-200 um from a nearest open microvessel. Tumor cells beyond this limit undergo apoptosis (Fig. 1). Therefore, almost any tumor that has reached a diameter of >10-100 mm, is probably already neovascularized. After the angiogenic switch, new microvessels converge on the dormant in situ tumor and tumor cells cluster around each microvessel in a cylindrical configuration. The radius of the microcylinder of tumor cells is limited by the oxygen diffusion requirements for that particular tumor, but it would be rare to find layers of viable tumor cells beyond 200 m (Fig. 1) [18]. The angiogenic switch is associated with a marked decrease (3- to 4-fold) in overall tumor cell apoptosis [5]. In contrast to apoptosis, the proliferation rate of tumor cells may remain at the same level and in many angiogenic tumors appears to be relatively independent of the onset of angiogenesis or its intensity [19]. The mechanisms of increased tumor cell survival and decreased tumor cell apoptosis after the onset of angiogenesis, depend not only on delivery of oxygen and nutrients and the removal of catabolites by new microvessels, but also on a paracrine release of anti-apoptotic factors from the endothelial cells in these new vessels. Microvascular endothelial cells recruited into a tumor bed supply at least 20 mitogens, anti-apoptotic factors, and survival factors (including among others, bFGF, HB-EGF, IL-6, G-CSF, IGF-1 and PDGF) for those tumor cells apposed to the new microvessels [20-22]. It is unclear whether angiogenesis inhibitors also directly decrease endothelial cell production of paracrine factors, but this could be tested in vitro. 3.

              "summary_text": "Angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated signals are transmitted via heparin binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF) release followed by transactivation of EGF receptor (EGFR). Although Ang II and HB-EGF induce angiogenesis, their link to the angiopoietin (Ang)-Tie2 system remains undefined. We tested the effects of Ang II on Ang1, Ang2, or Tie2 expression in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells expressing the Ang II receptors AT(1) and AT(2). Ang II significantly induced Ang2 mRNA accumulations without affecting Ang1 or Tie2 expression, which was inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitors and by intracellular Ca(2+) chelating agents. Ang II transactivated EGFR via AT(1), and inhibition of EGFR abolished the induction of Ang2. Ang II caused processing of pro-HB-EGF in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner to stimulate maturation and release of HB-EGF. Neutralizing anti-HB-EGF antibody blocked EGFR phosphorylation by Ang II. Ang II also upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in an HB-EGF/EGFR-dependent manner. AT(2) inhibited AT(1)-mediated Ang2 expression and phosphorylation of EGFR. In an in vivo corneal assay, AT(1) induced angiogenesis in an HB-EGF-dependent manner and enhanced the angiogenic activity of VEGF. Although neither Ang2 nor Ang1 alone induced angiogenesis, soluble Tie2-Fc that binds to angiopoietins attenuated AT(1)-mediated angiogenesis. These findings suggested that (1) Ang II induces Ang2 and VEGF expression without affecting Ang1 or Tie2 and (2) AT(1) stimulates processing of pro-HB-EGF by metalloproteinases, and the released HB-EGF transactivates EGFR to induce angiogenesis via the combined effect of Ang2 and VEGF, whereas AT(2) attenuates them by blocking EGFR phosphorylation. Thus, Ang II is involved in the VEGF-Ang-Tie2 system via HB-EGF-mediated EGFR transactivation, and this link should be considerable in pathological conditions in which collateral blood flow is required.",

In the same model, systemic administration of anti-VEGF-A neutralizing antibodies dramatically reduces FGF2-induced vascularization [82]; (v) VEGFR-1-blocking antibodies or the expression of a dominant-negative VEGFR-1 result in a significant reduction of FGF2-induced cell extensions and capillary morphogenesis [56]; (vi) FGF2 upregulates the expression of both FGFRs and VEGFRs in endothelial cells [100].",

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

Recently, the potential interaction of TL1A in microbial-host interaction was illustrated by a report showing microbial organisms can induce TL1A in APCs [46]. Microbial-activated TL1A was in part mediated by TLR 1, 2, 4, and 9 signaling pathways and dependent on downstream p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1) [46]. Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis. Our group showed that TLR8 or TLR7/8 ligand (R848) can inhibit TL1A production in a dose dependent manner [47•].",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

Furthermore, berberine attenuated high glucose-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, cellular apoptosis, nuclear factor-kappaB activation, and expression of adhesion molecules, thus suppressing monocyte attachment to endothelial cells. In mouse aortic rings, berberine elicited endothelium-dependent vasodilatations and alleviated high glucose-mediated endothelial dysfunction. All these beneficial effects of berberine on the endothelium were abolished by either pharmacological inhibition of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative version of AMPK.

In the SAN and AVN, ACh and Ado share the same pathways for signal transduction. ACh binds to the muscarinic M2 receptor, which is coupled to a \\\"direct\\\" G protein-dependent pathway activating Kir3.1/Kir3.4 (GIRK1/GIRK4) channel complexes. Beside this direct pathway, two other \\\"indirect\\\" channel regulation pathways lead to downregulation of intracellular cAMP. In the first cascade of events, the {alpha}Gi protein subunit inhibits AC activity, thereby reducing the synthesis of cAMP. Inhibition of AC synthesis is viewed as the predominant pathway by which ACh regulates the voltage dependence of f-channels (HCN). The second muscarinic pathway is initiated by the stimulation of the NOS activity and production of NO. NOS activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (GC), which converts GTP in cGMP. Elevation of cGMP concentration stimulates PDE II-dependent hydrolysis of cAMP, thereby reducing PKA activity. This NOS-dependent pathway for regulation of PKA activity has been proposed to be the major pathway for the muscarinic regulation of ICa,L during pacemaking. In the figure, negative NOS-dependent regulation of Cav1.3-mediated ICa,L and Ist is suggested. It is not known if the SAN IKr can also be negatively regulated by the NOS-dependent pathway.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

We also provide evidence that APE/Ref-1 can modulate the cooperative activation of the blk promoter operated by Pax5a and EBF and that APE/Ref-1 might directly regulate EBF functional activity.

The cells were subsequently stimulated via CD40 using CHO-CD154 for 16 h. Stimulation of both the wild-type and hCD 32 mutant resulted in a 3-fold induction of NF-kappaB luciferase activity above background, whereas stimulation of the hCD40EEAA mutant did not result in detectable stimulation of NF-kappaB reporter activity (Fig. 9A).

Moreover, neutrophil recruitment in a model of thioglycollate-induced peritonitis is impaired in CD40-deficient mice. In vitro data revealed that CD40 deficiency blocked CD40L-induced NF-kB p65 nuclear translocation in leukocytes. Altogether, our data identified for the first time that CD40 is essential in the upregulation of TRAF6, NF-kB activation, and NF-kB-dependent proinflammatory genes in vivo. ",

              "summary_text": "However, because leptin improved insulin sensitivity in rodents (61) and in humans (62) with lipodystrophy, this makes it an unlikely contributor to the inflammatory response associated with obesity. Resistin was originally reported as an adipose tissue-specific hormone that provided a link between obesity and diabetes. Resistin is part of a new class of cysteine-rich secreted proteins that were found, by one of the groups who discovered it, to be induced during lung inflammation (found in inflammatory zone 1 [FIZZ1]). In vitro studies have shown that resistin mRNA expression is increased by proinflammatory cytokines in human mononuclear cells (63) and that resistin has a direct proinflammatory effect, probably mediated through nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) signaling pathway on vascular endothelial human cells (64). In rodents, resistin affects glucose tolerance and is related with whole-body and hepatic insulin resistance (65,66). Differences in resistin gene expression have been observed between human and mice tissues. While in mice adipocytes are the mayor source of circulating resistin, in humans secretion or expression is predominantly found in mononuclear cells, and the release of resistin by explants of adipose tissue in primary culture is largely derived from the nonfat cells present in the explants (67). Resistin is detectable in human serum, and its circulating levels were found to be elevated in proportion to the degree of adiposity (68,69). Although these data might suggest a contribution of resistin to inflammation and insulin resistance, the role of resistin in obesity has not been proven (68,69). Finally, other proinflammatory adipokines, such as complement C3 and macrophage inhibitor factor, were inversely and independently associated with insulin sensitivity (70,71). Adiponectin is the anti-inflammatory adipokine that has been studied most extensively. It is produced exclusively by white adipocytes but is paradoxically lower in obese versus lean individuals (72). Adiponectin has been related to insulin resistance and diabetes not only because of its AMP-activated protein kinase effects on FFA metabolism and glucose uptake but also because of its anti-inflammatory properties. Inhibition of phagocyte activity and TNF-alpha production by macrophages and inhibition of the TNF-alpha- induced expression of adhesion molecules (through NF-kappaB signaling pathways) are some of the known mechanisms by which adiponectin mediate its anti-inflammatory effects (73). Many studies have now suggested that in humans adiponectin is more closely related to insulin resistance than to obesity (73). Prospective and longitudinal studies (74 -78) have found a correlation between low adiponectin levels and a higher risk of diabetes, independent of many confounders including obesity and other inflammatory markers (75,79).

(79) hypothesized that in studies in which substantial baseline differences in the degree of adiposity exist, the predictive value of inflammatory markers may be a result of their association with obesity, i.e., they may be acting as surrogate markers of hypoadiponectinemia and may be only indirectly associated with the development of diabetes (Fig. 1B) (Table 2). Adipose tissue is also a source of other anti-inflammatory cytokines whose roles are mostly unknown. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by immune cells (T-helper, B-cells, and macrophages). In mice, IL-10 treatment prevented IL-6-induced defects in both hepatic and skeletal insulin action (56). Circulating IL-10 is elevated in human obesity (80); in adipose tissue, IL-10 is primarily produced by nonfat cells (81). In humans, lower serum concentrations of IL-10 were associated with the metabolic syndrome (80) and with diabetes (82).

In the present study, we directly demonstrate binding of hsp60 to the macrophage surface and find the binding receptor for hsp60 different from the previously described common receptor for several other heat shock proteins, including hsp70, hsp90, and gp96. Fluorescence-labeled human hsp60 bound to cell surfaces of the murine macrophage lines J774 A.1 and RAW264.7 and to mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. By flow cytometry, we could demonstrate for the first time that hsp60 binding to macrophages occurred at submicromolar concentrations, is saturable, and can be competed by unlabeled hsp60, but not by unrelated proteins, thus confirming the classic characteristics of specific ligand-receptor interactions. Binding of hsp60 at 4 degrees C was followed by endocytosis at 37 degrees C. Hsp60 binding to macrophages could not be competed by excess hsp70, hsp90, or gp96, all of which share the alpha(2)-macroglobulin receptor as binding site. Hsp60 binding occurred in the absence of surface TLR4. However, no cytokine response was induced by hsp60 in TLR4-deficient macrophages. We conclude that hsp60 binds to a stereo-specific receptor on macrophages, and that different surface molecules are engaged in binding and signal transduction. Furthermore, the binding site for hsp60 is separate from the common receptor for hsp70, hsp90, and gp96, which suggests an independent role of hsp60 as danger Ag and in immunoregulation.",

Increased GRK2 and GRK5 expression results in chemokine receptor internalization and desensitization, thereby negatively regulating PMN migration. Thus, PI3K-?-activated signaling is postulated to be a feedback mechanism regulating PMN migration. Because persistent infection requires continued PMN infiltration, LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling pathway transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response to MIP-2. This decreases chemokine receptor desensitization by preventing CXCR2 internalization and thus augments PMN migration. MEK kinase is involved in mediating the crosstalk between TLR4 and chemokine receptors. Dashed lines indicate inhibitory signals.",

Long pentraxins consist of a C-terminal pentraxin domain, which has sequence similarity to C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P (SAP) component (the classic short pentraxins), and of an unrelated N-terminal portion. PTX3 is made by diverse cell types, most prominently endothelial cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, in response to primary inflammatory signals (e.g. interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). It binds diverse ligands, including microbial moieties, C1q and apoptotic cells. Evidence suggests that PTX3 plays a role in the regulation of innate resistance to pathogens, inflammatory reactions, possibly clearance of self-components and female fertility.",

Immunoblot analysis with anti-CYP3A2 and anti-CYP2D2 sera indicated that indomethacin-induced decreases in expression of the proteins recognized by the antibodies were attenuated in the LPS-resistant mice.

Increased GRK2 and GRK5 expression results in chemokine receptor internalization and desensitization, thereby negatively regulating PMN migration. Thus, PI3K-?-activated signaling is postulated to be a feedback mechanism regulating PMN migration. Because persistent infection requires continued PMN infiltration, LPS acting through the TLR4 signaling pathway transcriptionally downregulates expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response to MIP-2. This decreases chemokine receptor desensitization by preventing CXCR2 internalization and thus augments PMN migration. MEK kinase is involved in mediating the crosstalk between TLR4 and chemokine receptors. Dashed lines indicate inhibitory signals.",

LPS stimulation induces NADPH oxidase activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PMNs as well as the initiation of MyD88-dependent NF-ÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂºB signaling in endothelial cells and the consequent expression of TLR2 and ICAM-1. Adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMNs to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells. The oxidants augment NF-ÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂºB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells and increased PMN migration.

Although this event supports the efficient induction of immune responses, it might also interfere with processes that are susceptible to chronic inflammation, such as wound healing after tissue damage. Therefore, Gp96-mediated stimulation of the immune system requires tight regulation. Here we show that human thrombocytes specifically interact with Gp96 and that binding of Gp96 to platelets is enhanced more than 10-fold on activation by thrombin. Gp96 interferes with neither thrombin-induced platelet activation nor platelet aggregation. However, the presence of platelets during Gp96-mediated DC activation reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of DCs.",

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is known to associate with dectin-1, TLR4 and ITAM receptors and regulate leukocyte cytoskeleton and Fc?R-dependent phagocytosis20-24. Yeast two-hybrid experiments, shown in Figure 3A, demonstrated that Syk can directly bind to the C-terminal domain of TLR4 and that this interaction was mediated by the N-terminal SH2 domain in the Syk molecule. We also found that mmLDL stimulated TLR4 phosphorylation (Figure 3B), suggesting that the mmLDL activation leads to an increased Syk SH2 domain binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues of TLR4. These results agree with our recent findings that mmLDL induced co-immunoprecipitation of TLR4 and Syk in a time-dependent manner as well as TLR4-dependent Syk phosphorylation24. Next, we generated a J774 line expressing Syk shRNA, which had no detectable Syk protein expression. The Syk-knockdown cells accumulated significantly less fluorescent dextran when activated with mmLDL, results fully replicated by the addition of 15LO-CE alone (Figure 3C)",

              "summary_text": "FIG. 24. Summary of the signaling pathways involved in the muscarinic regulation of pacemaker activity. In the SAN and AVN, ACh and Ado share the same pathways for signal transduction. ACh binds to the muscarinic M2 receptor, which is coupled to a \\\"direct\\\" G protein-dependent pathway activating Kir3.1/Kir3.4 (GIRK1/GIRK4) channel complexes. Beside this direct pathway, two other \\\"indirect\\\" channel regulation pathways lead to downregulation of intracellular cAMP. In the first cascade of events, the {alpha}Gi protein subunit inhibits AC activity, thereby reducing the synthesis of cAMP. Inhibition of AC synthesis is viewed as the predominant pathway by which ACh regulates the voltage dependence of f-channels (HCN). The second muscarinic pathway is initiated by the stimulation of the NOS activity and production of NO. NOS activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (GC), which converts GTP in cGMP. Elevation of cGMP concentration stimulates PDE II-dependent hydrolysis of cAMP, thereby reducing PKA activity. This NOS-dependent pathway for regulation of PKA activity has been proposed to be the major pathway for the muscarinic regulation of ICa,L during pacemaking. In the figure, negative NOS-dependent regulation of Cav1.3-mediated ICa,L and Ist is suggested. It is not known if the SAN IKr can also be negatively regulated by the NOS-dependent pathway.",

Furthermore, berberine attenuated high glucose-induced generation of reactive oxygen species, cellular apoptosis, nuclear factor-kappaB activation, and expression of adhesion molecules, thus suppressing monocyte attachment to endothelial cells. In mouse aortic rings, berberine elicited endothelium-dependent vasodilatations and alleviated high glucose-mediated endothelial dysfunction. All these beneficial effects of berberine on the endothelium were abolished by either pharmacological inhibition of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or adenovirus-mediated overexpression of a dominant negative version of AMPK.

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

In addition to its DH domain with GEF activity, LSC has a regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) domain, which binds to Galpha proteins and increases their intrinsic GTPase activity, thereby turning off GPCR signalling. So LSC seems to carry out two functions. First, it transduces GPCR signals from Galpha12 and Galpha13 proteins to activate RHOA and second, it attenuates other Galpha12- or Galpha13-coupled GPCR signals. In LSC-deficient mice, the number of B cells is decreased as are T cell-dependent antibody responses to protein antigens owing to a cell-intrinsic requirement for LSC in B cells27, 28. Further analysis has shown that LSC-deficient marginal zone B cells migrate more effectively in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in vitro, which might be due to the loss of LSC-mediated inhibition of signalling from Galpha12/13-coupled S1P receptors. By contrast, LSC-deficient marginal zone B cells have a defect in their ability to detach from ICAM1 and they do not migrate to the follicles following LPS stimulation in vivo. The defects in migration to the follicles might reflect a requirement for LSC-mediated RHOA activation in the disengagement of integrin binding at the trailing edge of the migrating B cell28. ",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

Since amino acids are required for cell growth, the present study examined the effect of PDGF on system L amino acid transport, which is the predominant cellular pathway for the uptake of essential amino acids. System L amino acid transport was monitored by measuring the uptake of L-leucine. Treatment of SMCs with PDGF stimulated L-leucine transport in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and this was associated with a selective increase in LAT1 mRNA and protein. PDGF failed to induce the expression of the other system L transport proteins, LAT2 and the heavy chain of the 4F2 cell surface antigen. The induction of LAT1 by PDGF was dependent on de novo RNA and protein synthesis and on mTOR activity. Serum, thrombin, and angiotensin II likewise stimulated L-leucine transport by inducing LAT1 expression. Inhibition of system L amino acid transport by the model substrate 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid blocked growth factor-mediated SMC proliferation and induced SMC apoptosis, whereas it had no effect on quiescent cells. These results demonstrate that growth factors stimulate system L amino acid transport by inducing LAT1 gene expression and that system L amino acid transport is essential for SMC proliferation and survival. The capacity of vascular mitogens to induce LAT1 expression may represent a basic mechanism by which tho acid transport * apoptosis",

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The biochemical mechanism leading to this clinical observation is unknown. We have previously reported high molecular weight kininogen (HK) inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by binding to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex. Although factor XII will bind to the intact platelet through GP Ibalpha (glycocalicin) without activation, we now report that factor XIIa (0. 37 microm), but not factor XII zymogen, is required for the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XIIa had no significant effect on SFLLRN-induced platelet aggregation. Moreover, an antibody to the thrombin site on protease-activated receptor-1 failed to block factor XII binding to platelets. Inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was demonstrated with factor XIIa but not with factor XII zymogen or factor XIIf, indicating that the conformational exposure of the heavy chain following proteolytic activation is required for inhibition. However, inactivation of the catalytic activity of factor XIIa did not affect the inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Factor XII showed displacement of biotin-labeled HK (30 nm) binding to gel-filtered platelets and, at concentrations of 50 nm, was able to block 50% of the HK binding, suggesting involvement of the GP Ib complex. Antibodies to GP Ib and GP IX, which inhibited HK binding to platelets, did not block factor XII binding. However, using a biosensor, which monitors protein-protein interactions, both HK and factor XII bind to GP Ibalpha. Factor XII may serve to regulate thrombin binding to the GP Ib receptor by co-localizing with HK, to control the extent of platelet aggregation in vivo.",

HGF/SF is secreted by stromal cells as an inactive precursor form, and is specifically activated by HGF activator (HGFA) to the active form. HGFA is also produced as a precursor form and activated by thrombin in injured tissues. The activity of HGFA is regulated by two recently identified Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitors, namely HGFA inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1) and type 2 (HAI-2). Although the activation of HGF/SF is a critical limiting step in the HGF/SF-induced signaling pathway, little is known about the regulation of HGF/SF activation in injured gastrointestinal mucosa. Immunohistochemically, all these proteins have been detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and HAI-1 was upregulated in regenerative epithelium relative to normal epithelium. During the course of acetic acid-induced murine experimental colitis, HAI-1, but not HAI-2, was indeed upregulated in the recovery phase. In vitro study revealed that HAI-1 is not only an inhibitor, but also a specific cell-surface binding protein, of active HGFA, and acts as a reservoir of this enzyme on the cell surface. Active HGFA/HAI-1 complexes were quickly released from the cell surface by treatment with IL-1beta accompanying significant recovery of HGFA activity in the culture supernatant. These results suggest that HAI-1 is a cell-surface acceptor of activated HGFA in regenerative epithelial cells, and functions on the cell surface to localize the active HGFA that is going to enter the repair process. This concentrated HGFA activity would ensure the efficient pericellular activation of HGF in the injured gastrointestinal mucosa, and promote the proliferation and migration of gastrointestinal epithelial cells.",

However, the origin of this transport protein is controversial and many organ sources have been suggested. We studied human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured in vitro. The cells contained TC II (2.3 pmol/10(8) cells) and released progressively increasing amounts of the protein into the surrounding medium during the 3-day incubation period. This release exceeded the starting intracellular content of TC II. In contrast, endothelial cells did not contain or elaborate R binder, the other major circulating binding protein for cobalamin, Cycloheximide inhibited the elaboration of TC II, suggesting that the endothelial cells synthesize the protein. Thrombin, which stimulates tissue plasminogen activator release, did not enhance TC II release, and neither did endotoxin or mellitin. However, thrombin did appear to partially protect TC II release from inhibition by cycloheximide. Among other cells studied, human fibroblasts also released TC II into the incubation medium, while K562 human leukemia cells, ARH-77 and HS Sultan human plasma cell lines, and Raji strain lymphoblasts did not. The data suggest that endothelial cells are an important source of the metabolically crucial TC II.",

Recently, the potential interaction of TL1A in microbial-host interaction was illustrated by a report showing microbial organisms can induce TL1A in APCs [46]. Microbial-activated TL1A was in part mediated by TLR 1, 2, 4, and 9 signaling pathways and dependent on downstream p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1) [46]. Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis. Our group showed that TLR8 or TLR7/8 ligand (R848) can inhibit TL1A production in a dose dependent manner [47•].",

Although this event supports the efficient induction of immune responses, it might also interfere with processes that are susceptible to chronic inflammation, such as wound healing after tissue damage. Therefore, Gp96-mediated stimulation of the immune system requires tight regulation. Here we show that human thrombocytes specifically interact with Gp96 and that binding of Gp96 to platelets is enhanced more than 10-fold on activation by thrombin. Gp96 interferes with neither thrombin-induced platelet activation nor platelet aggregation. However, the presence of platelets during Gp96-mediated DC activation reduces the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of DCs.",

MEKK1 (MEK kinase-1) and MEKK3 have been implicated in the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK (27). To examine whether MEKK1 or MEKK3 is involved in the RIG-I/IPS-1 pathway, we performed an IFN-beta and NF-kappaB reporter assay using kinase-inactive mutants of MEKK1 (knMEKK1) and MEKK3 (knMEKK3). As shown in Fig. 4A, IPS-1- and RIG-IN-induced IFN-beta promoter and NF-kappaB activities were inhibited efficiently by knMEKK1 and to a lesser extent by knMEKK3. Next we examined the effect of overexpression of MEKK1 and MEKK3. The forced expression of IRF3, MEKK1, or MEKK3 alone was not sufficient for the activation of the IFN-beta promoter; however, cotransfection of IRF3 and MEKK1, but not MEKK3 synergistically activated the promoter activity (Fig. 4B). In order to confirm the significance of endogenous MEKK1 and MEKK3, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. Wild-type MEFs were transfected with scrambled control, MEKK1, or MEKK3 siRNA construct, and then endogenous gene expression of MEKK1 as well as MEKK3 was sufficiently suppressed (Fig. 4C). The knockdown of MEKK1, but not MEKK3, resulted in a severe reduction of IFN-beta mRNA expression induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 4C). Induction of mRNA for IP-10 was slightly suppressed in the MEKK1 knockdown MEFs. Significant reduction of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta levels by knockdown of MEKK1 with different siRNA oligonucleotides was also confirmed by real time PCR (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the suppression of type I IFNs by siRNA for MEKK1 was reverted by forced expression of rat MEKK1 (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that endogenous MEKK1 but not MEKK3 is required for type I IFN production induced by cytoplasmic dsRNA.",

              "summary_text": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria including H pylori, is a signalling molecule for the innate immune system and is the main source of infl ammation in Gram-negative infections[55]. LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

MEKK1 (MEK kinase-1) and MEKK3 have been implicated in the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK (27). To examine whether MEKK1 or MEKK3 is involved in the RIG-I/IPS-1 pathway, we performed an IFN-beta and NF-kappaB reporter assay using kinase-inactive mutants of MEKK1 (knMEKK1) and MEKK3 (knMEKK3). As shown in Fig. 4A, IPS-1- and RIG-IN-induced IFN-beta promoter and NF-kappaB activities were inhibited efficiently by knMEKK1 and to a lesser extent by knMEKK3. Next we examined the effect of overexpression of MEKK1 and MEKK3. The forced expression of IRF3, MEKK1, or MEKK3 alone was not sufficient for the activation of the IFN-beta promoter; however, cotransfection of IRF3 and MEKK1, but not MEKK3 synergistically activated the promoter activity (Fig. 4B). In order to confirm the significance of endogenous MEKK1 and MEKK3, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. Wild-type MEFs were transfected with scrambled control, MEKK1, or MEKK3 siRNA construct, and then endogenous gene expression of MEKK1 as well as MEKK3 was sufficiently suppressed (Fig. 4C). The knockdown of MEKK1, but not MEKK3, resulted in a severe reduction of IFN-beta mRNA expression induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 4C). Induction of mRNA for IP-10 was slightly suppressed in the MEKK1 knockdown MEFs. Significant reduction of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta levels by knockdown of MEKK1 with different siRNA oligonucleotides was also confirmed by real time PCR (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the suppression of type I IFNs by siRNA for MEKK1 was reverted by forced expression of rat MEKK1 (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that endogenous MEKK1 but not MEKK3 is required for type I IFN production induced by cytoplasmic dsRNA.",

              "summary_text": "All living organisms are exposed constantly to microorganisms that are present in the environment and need to cope with invasion of these organisms into the body. The vertebrate immune response can be divided into innate and acquired immunity, with innate immunity being the first line of defence against pathogens. By contrast, acquired immune responses are slower processes, which are mediated by T and B cells, both of which express highly diverse antigen receptors that are generated through DNA rearrangement and are thereby able to respond to a wide range of potential antigens. This highly sophisticated system of antigen detection is found only in vertebrates and has been the subject of considerable research. Far less attention has been directed towards innate immunity, as it has been regarded as a relatively nonspecific system, with its main roles being to destroy pathogens and to present antigen to the cells involved in acquired immunity. However, recent studies have shown that the innate immune system has a greater degree of specificity than was previously thought and that it is highly developed in its ability to discriminate between self and foreign pathogens1. This discrimination relies, to a great extent, on a family of evolutionarily conserved receptors, known as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have a crucial role in early host defence against invading pathogens1, 2. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite for the induction of acquired immunity, particularly for the induction of a T helper 1 (TH1)-cell response3, 4. This marked shift in our thinking has changed our ideas about the pathogenesis and treatment of cancers, and infectious, immune and allergic diseases. In the past few years, our knowledge of TLR signalling and the responses these receptors control has greatly increased. In this review, we discuss the TLRs, focusing on their signalling pathways.  TLR/IL-1R superfamily: structure and function  The discovery of the TLR family began with the identification of Toll, a receptor that is expressed by insects and was found to be essential for establishing dorsoventral polarity during embryogenesis5. Subsequent studies revealed that Toll also has an essential role in the insect innate immune response against fungal infection6. Homologues of Toll were identified through database searches, and so far, 11 members of the TLR family have been identified in mammals. The TLRs are type I integral membrane glycoproteins, and on the basis of considerable homology in the cytoplasmic region, they are members of a larger superfamily that includes the interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs). By contrast, the extracellular region of the TLRs and IL-1Rs differs markedly: the extracellular region of TLRs contains leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, whereas the extracellular region of IL-1Rs contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (Fig. 1a).     Figure 1 |  TLR structure and signalling.  a | Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) have a conserved cytoplasmic domain, that is known as the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. The TIR domain is characterized by the presence of three highly homologous regions (known as boxes 1, 2 and 3). Despite the similarity of the cytoplasmic domains of these molecules, their extracellular regions differ markedly: TLRs have tandem repeats of leucine-rich regions (known as leucine rich repeats, LRR), whereas IL-1Rs have three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. b | Stimulation of TLRs triggers the association of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88), which in turn recruits IRAK4 (IL-1R-associated kinase 4), thereby allowing the association of IRAK1. IRAK4 then induces the phosphorylation of IRAK1. TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) is also recruited to the receptor complex, by associating with phosphorylated IRAK1.

However, it is not clear whether TRAF6 mediates the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI. Therefore, we examined whether TRAF6 is implicated in the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI by using transient transfection of TRAF6 siRNA. Knockdown of TRAF6 abrogated not only the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI under unstimulated conditions (Fig. 7A) but also the phosphorylation of TAK1 and MKK3, a downstream effector of TAK1 induced by TGF-beta1 stimulation in MMC (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that TRAF6 mediates the interaction of TAK1 with TbetaRI as well as TGF-beta1-induced TAK1 activation.",

We tested the requirement of these molecules in IL-17F–induced inflammatory gene expression. Induction of CXCL1 was impaired in TRAF6?/? MEFs upon IL-17F treatment (Fig. 2 C). Also, although WT MEFs up-regulated the expression of IL-6, CXCL-1, and the transcriptional regulators CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ? and I?B? upon IL-17F treatment, Act1-deficient MEFs did not (Fig. 2 D). Our results thus indicate that similar to IL-17, IL-17F requires both Act1 and TRAF6 for its signal transduction leading to inflammatory gene expression.",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Cse4p has a unique 135-amino-acid N terminus and a C-terminal histone-fold domain that is more than 60% identical to histone H3 and the mammalian centromere protein CENP-A. Cse4p and CENP-A have biochemical properties similar to H3 and probably replace H3 in centromere-specific nucleosomes in yeasts and mammals, respectively. In order to identify regions of Cse4p that distinguish it from H3 and confer centromere function, a systematic site-directed mutational analysis was performed. Nested deletions of the Cse4p N terminus showed that this region of the protein contains at least one essential domain. The C-terminal histone-fold domain of Cse4p was analyzed by changing Cse4p amino acids that differ between Cse4p and H3 to the analogous H3 residues. Extensive substitution of contiguous Cse4p residues with H3 counterparts resulted in cell lethality. However, all large lethal substitution alleles could be subdivided into smaller viable alleles, many of which caused elevated rates of mitotic chromosome loss. The results indicate that residues critical for wild-type Cse4p function and high-fidelity chromosome transmission are distributed across the entire histone-fold domain. Our findings are discussed in the context of the known structure of H3 within the nucleosome and compared with previous results reported for CENP-A.",

              "summary_text": "The members of this family share a region of homology that spans the first 300 N-terminal amino acids known as the NF- k-B/Rel/dorsal region or Rel homology domain; it is responsible for dimerization, DNA binding, and nuclear translocation of NFk- B (Fig. 2) [211, 408-411]. The Rel homology domain consists of three regions, including a nuclear localization sequence, a DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization region [405]. Functional NF- kB is composed of dimers formed from p50, p52, Rel A (p65), Rel B, and c-Rel proteins [412-414]. In unstimulated cells, the nuclear localization sequence of NF-kB is bound to inhibitory proteins (IkB), thus maintaining it in the cytosol [415]. IkB proteins include IkBa [416] IkBb [417], IkBg [418,419], and possibly Bcl-3 [420,421]. Interestingly, the proteins previously believed to be precursor proteins of p50 and p52 known as p105 [422,423] and p100 [424] also exhibit IkB activity [424-426]. Recently, it was found that both p105 and p50 are generated from the same transcript but that the p105 protein is not actually a precursor of p50 [427]. The best studied of the IkB proteins is IkBa. Stimulation of cells leads to hyperphosphorylation of IkBaserines 32 and 36 [428-431] via activation of Nik, which phosphorylates IkB kinase (Fig. 2) [432-434]. Phosphorylation alone has no effect on the binding of the inhibitor to NF-kB [430,435,436]; however, it does provide a signal for ubiquitination at lysines 21 and 22 [437-439], which stimulates degradation of IkBaby the 26S proteasome complex. Dissociation of IkB and NF-kB proteins permits migration of the active NF-kB dimer to the nucleus [440], where it can bind to DNA and initiate transcription. ROS activate NF-kB by causing the release of the inhibitory subunit (IkB) from the NF-kB complex [11].",

              "summary_text": "The degeneration of nigral dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) reportedly involves a defect in brain mitochondrial complex I in association with the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and caspase-3. To elucidate molecular mechanisms possibly linking these events, as well as to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the cyclopentenone prostaglandin A1 (PGA1), an inducer of heat shock proteins (HSPs), we exposed human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells to the complex I inhibitor rotenone. Dose-dependent apoptosis was preceded by the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and then the activation of caspase-3 over the ensuing 24 h. PGA1 increased the expression of HSP70 and HSP27 and protected against rotenone-induced apoptosis, without increasing necrotic death. PGA1 blocked the rotenone-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and attenuated, but did not abolish, the caspase-3 elevation. Unexpectedly, the caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD.CHO (DEVD), at a concentration that completely prevented the caspase-3 elevation produced by rotenone, failed to protect against apoptosis. These results suggest that complex I deficiency in dopamine cells can induce apoptosis by a process involving early NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and caspase-3 activation. PGA1 appears to protect against rotenone-induced cell death by inducing HSPs and blocking nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in a process that attenuates caspase-3 activation, but is not mediated by its inhibition.",

              "summary_text": "Endocrine therapy with an estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted antiestrogen, such as tamoxifen, or estrogen ablation by aromatase inhibitors is clinically indicated for the management of all forms of ER-positive breast cancer. However, 30-50% of ER-positive breast cancer cases fail to benefit clinically from endocrine therapy alone, and recent molecular evidence suggests that 'crosstalk' pathways originating from activated receptor tyrosine kinases and/or other proliferative and survival signals may be contributing to this endocrine resistance. Molecular identification and validation of candidate ER crosstalking pathways will likely lead to clinically important prognostic markers and targets for the application of novel therapeutics in combination with standard endocrine agents. This review focuses on a critical survival and proliferation pathway involving activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that for nearly two decades have been known to be critical regulators of mammalian immune and inflammatory responses, and more recently have been associated with chemotherapy resistance. With the demonstration that activation of NFkappaB is absolutely required for normal mammary gland development, NFkappaB involvment in human breast cancers was initially explored and linked to the development of hormone-independent (ER-negative) breast cancer. Newer clinical evidence now implicates NFkappaB activation, particularly DNA-binding by the p50 subunit of NFkappaB, as a potential prognostic marker capable of identifying a high-risk subset of ER-positive, primary breast cancers destined for early relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen. Furthermore, initial preclinical studies suggest that treatment strategies designed to prevent or interrupt activation of NFkappaB in cell-line models of these more aggressive, ER-positive breast cancers can restore their sensitivity to such standard endocrine agents as tamoxifen.",

However, downstream signaling pathways activated by non-bacterial agonists are not known. Thus, we determined the downstream signaling pathways derived from saturated fatty acid-induced TLR4 activation. Saturated fatty acid (lauric acid)-induced NFkB activation was inhibited by a dominant negative (DN) mutant of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF6, or IkBa in macrophages (RAW264.7) and 293T cells transfected with TLR4 and MD-2. Lauric acid induced the transient phosphorylation of AKT. LY294002, PI3K(DN), or AKT(DN) inhibited NFkB activation, p65 transactivation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression induced by lauric acid or constitutively active (CA) TLR4. AKT(DN) blocked MyD88-induced NFkB activation suggesting that AKT is a MyD88-dependent downstream signaling component of TLR4. AKT(CA) was sufficient to induce NFkB activation and COX-2 expression. These results demonstrate that NFkB activation and COX-2 expression induced by lauric acid is at least partly mediated through TLR4/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In contrast, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT induced by LPS or lauric acid. DHA also suppressed NFkB activation induced by TLR4(CA), but not MyD88(CA) or AKT(CA) suggesting that the molecular targets of DHA are signaling components upstream of MyD88 and AKT. Together, these results suggest that saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids reciprocally modulate the activation of TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathways involving MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 and PI3K/AKT, and further suggest a possibility that TLR4-mediated target gene expression and cellular responses are also differentially modulated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.",

A strong driving force in sustaining the long lasting efforts to understand the function and regulation of MYC is its potent role as an oncoprotein in human tumors. The first myc gene emerged almost 30 years ago when it was realized that several highly transforming chicken retroviruses had captured a cellular sequence that transformed myeloid cells among others, hence the name myc for myelomonocytic leukemia (1, 2). In mammals several MYC genes, includingMYC(formerly c-MYC, gene and protein symbols as proposed by the Human Genome Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/ index.html)), MYCN, and MYCL, have been identified. All three have been implicated in the genesis of human malignancies and suffer in many instances from different genetic alterations, including translocations and amplifications (for a more detailed overview see supplemental Fig. S1) (3, 4). In addition the MYC promoter is targeted by multiple signal transduction cascades, including the WNT, RAS/RAF/MAPK,2 JAK/STAT, transforming growth factor beta, and NF-kappaB pathways, that are deregulated in cancer cells and contribute to enhanced MYC expression (5, 6). These tumor-associated alterations in general deregulate and enhance MYC expression.",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

The role of NF-kappaB in the cumulative changes in gene expression with transformation and progression of the murine SCC Pam 212 and after switching off NF-kappaB by a dominant negative inhibitor kappaB mutant (IkappaBalphaM) was explored by profiling with a 15,000-element cDNA micoarrray. Remarkably, NF-kappaB modulated the expression of 60% of the 308 genes differentially expressed between normal keratinocytes and metastatic SCCs. NF-kappaB directly or indirectly modulated expression of programs of genes functionally linked to proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and angiogenesis. Among these, changes in expression of cyclin D1, inhibitor of apoptosis-1, mutant Trp53, and beta-catenin detected with modulation of NF-kappaB by microarray were confirmed by Western and Northern blot. NF-kappaB DNA binding motifs were detected in the promoter of approximately 63% of genes showing increased expression and 33% of the genes showing decreased expression. The ACTACAG motif implicated in the NF-kappaB-dependent down-regulation of mRNA expression of MyoD and Sox9 was detected in the coding portion of about 15% of genes showing increased or decreased expression. Inactivation of NF-kappaB inhibited malignant phenotypic features including proliferation, cell survival, migration, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. These results provide evidence that NF-kappaB is an important modulator of gene expression programs that contribute to the malignant phenotype of SCC.",

              "summary_text": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is tightly regulated by the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and plays a central role in regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic stress. Metformin has been shown to activate AMPK. We hypothesized that metformin may prevent nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines. Metformin was observed to activate AMPK, as well as its downstream target, phosphoacetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Metformin also dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB kinase activity. Furthermore, metformin attenuated the TNF-alpha-induced gene expression of various proinflammatory and cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in HUVECs. A pharmacological activator of AMPK, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced NF-kappaB reporter gene expression. AICAR also suppressed the TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced gene expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in HUVECs. The small interfering RNA for AMPKalpha1 attenuated metformin or AICAR-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha, suggesting a possible role of AMPK in the regulation of cell inflammation. In light of these findings, we suggest that metformin attenuates the cytokine-induced expression of proinflammatory and adhesion molecule genes by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation via AMPK activation. Thus, it might be useful to target AMPK signaling in future efforts to prevent atherogenic and inflammatory vascular disease.",

Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

In the first data column, -fold changes of genes identified in two independent primary microarray screens of WT MEFs compared with WT. MEFs constitutively expressing the Ikappa Balpha (SS32/36AA) superrepressor are provided. In data columns 2-4, the dependences of each of these genes on IKKalpha , NEMO/IKKgamma , and IKKbeta were determined in six independent microarray screens wherein WT MEFs were compared with mutant MEFs null for the individual IKK subunits. -Fold change values from duplicate screenings were listed together. Dependence on one or more signalsome subunits was stringently evaluated by adhering to two criteria: wild type MEF absolute calls of \\\"present\\\" (P) and \\\"increase\\\" (I) average difference calls. Each screen was performed with cells stimulated for 2 h with 10 ng/ml human TNFalpha . Genes that were dependent on basal NF-kappa B for their expression were identified by performing independent microarray screens in the absence of TNFalpha stimulation. Redundancy hits (corresponding to different oligonucleotide regions of the same gene) are noted in the gene description column. NC denotes a \\\"no change\\\" average difference call, indicating no significant dependence on that IKK subunit. Results of exposure to TNFalpha are presented in the indicated column as follows: - (no significant effect), +/- (~2-5-fold stimulation), and + (>10-fold stimulated).

              "summary_text": "In order to identify genes associated with metastasis, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed using murine osteosarcoma cell line Dunn and its subline with higher metastatic potential, LM8. SSH revealed expression of the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP; also known as p97) to be constitutively activated in LM8 cells, but it declined in Dunn cells when the cells became confluent. Because VCP is known to be involved in the ubiquitination process of Inhibitor-kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), an inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), whether VCP influences NFkappaB activation or not was examined by using VCP-transfected Dunn cells (Dunn/VCPs). When stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), Dunn/VCPs showed constantly activated NFkappaB, although in the original Dunn cells and control vector transfectant (Dunn/Dunn-c) NFkappaB activation ceased when the cells became confluent. Western immunoblot analysis showed an increase of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha (p-IkappaBalpha) in the cytoplasm of confluent Dunn/Dunn-c cells compared to that of Dunn/VCPs. Therefore, decrease of p-IkappaBalpha degrading activity might be responsible for the decrease in NFkappaB activation. In vitro apoptosis assay demonstrated increased apoptosis rates of Dunn/Dunn-c cells after TNFalpha stimulation compared to those of Dunn/VCPs and LM8 cells. In vivo metastasis assay showed increased incidences of metastatic events in Dunn/VCP-1 inoculated male C3H mice compared to those in Dunn/Dunn-c inoculated mice. These findings suggested that VCP expression plays an important role in the metastatic process. Anti-apoptotic potential in these cells owing to constant NFkappaB activation via efficient cytoplasmic p-IkappaBalpha degrading activity may explain the increased metastatic potential of these cells.",

              "summary_text": "LOX-1, a receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. LOX-1 activation also plays an important role in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. A number of studies show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce total LDL cholesterol and exert a cardioprotective effect. We examined the modulation of LOX-1 expression and its function by two different statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin, in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). We observed that ox-LDL (40 microg/ml) treatment up-regulated the expression of E- and P-selectins, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in HCAECs. Ox-LDL mediated these effects via LOX-1, since antisense to LOX-1 mRNA decreased LOX-1 expression and subsequent adhesion molecule expression. Pretreatment of HCAECs with simvastatin or atorvastatin (1 and 10 microM) reduced ox-LDL-induced expression of LOX-1 as well as adhesion molecules (all P microM) was more potent than the low concentration (1 microM) (P Both statins reduced ox-LDL-mediated activation of the redox-sensitive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) but not AP-1. These observations indicate that LOX-1 activation plays an important role in ox-LDL-induced expression of adhesion molecules. Inhibition of expression of LOX-1 and adhesion molecules and activation of NF-kappaB may be another mechanism of beneficial effects of statins in vascular diseases.",

              "summary_text": "Extensive data indicate that oncoproteins, such as oncogenic H-Ras, initiate signal transduction cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of specific transcription factors. We and others have previously demonstrated that Ras activates the inherent transcriptional activation function of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Supportive of the importance of NF-kappaB in transformation, Ras-induced cellular transformation can be suppressed by expression of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or by dominant-negative forms of the upstream activator IkappaB kinase (IKK). However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.",

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

Microbial-activated TL1A was in part mediated by TLR 1, 2, 4, and 9 signaling pathways and dependent on downstream p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1) [46]. Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis. Our group showed that TLR8 or TLR7/8 ligand (R848) can inhibit TL1A production in a dose dependent manner [47•].",

LPS stimulation induces NADPH oxidase activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PMNs as well as the initiation of MyD88-dependent NF-ÃŽÂºB signaling in endothelial cells and the consequent expression of TLR2 and ICAM-1. Adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMNs to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells. The oxidants augment NF-ÃŽÂºB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells and increased PMN migration. Thus, the PMN NADPH oxidaseÃ¢â‚¬â€œmediated TLR4-TLR2 cross talk activates a positive feedback signal leading to sustained and amplified endothelial activation in response to invading pathogens.",

As shown in Fig. 4F, withHuR knockdown, no VCAM-1 can be detected in the ChIP assay in LPStreated cells, in shape contrast with LPS-treated control (NS siRNAtransfected) cellswhere a high level ofVCAM-1 was detected.

This data establishes the IL-12 p35 gene as a new target of c-Rel and shows that the regulation of IL-12 p70 expression at the transcriptional level by Rel/NF-kappaB is controlled through both the p35 and p40 genes in a cell type-specific fashion.",

The -300 bp CCL3 promoter and -222 bp CCL4 promoter were strongly up-regulated by co-transfection with the C/EBPb expression vector. Mutation of the C/EBPb motif and reduction of C/EBPb expression by siRNA decreased the up-regulation. Additionally, another cytokine-related transcription factor, NF-kB, was also shown to be involved in the up-regulation of chemokines in response to IL-1?, and the binding site was identified. The regulation of C/EBPb and NF-kB was confirmed by the inhibition by C/EBPb and NF-kB and by transfection with C/EBPk and NF-kB expression vectors in the presence or absence of IL-1b.",

Furthermore co-transfetcion of M1.CAT promoter (CSF promoter contains two tendem kB sites) with expression vector RSVp65 alone in bovine endothelial cells resulted in a 13 fold induction in M1 promoter compared to 5.7 fold with a combination of p65 and p50 and 2.2 fold induction with p50 alone.

Phosphorylation by JNK increases the ability of c-Jun to activate AP-1-dependent transcription. To determine whether the sustained JNK activation that occurred in response to TNF and NF-kappaB inhibition resulted in increased c-Jun activation, AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity was measured in untreated and TNF treated cells. RALA hepatocytes were transiently transfected with the AP-1-driven firefly luciferase reporter construct Coll73-Luc, and the constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK for normalization. No significant increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity occurred in Ad5LacZ-infected cells at 4 hours after TNF treatment (Fig. 1B). AP-1 transcriptional activity in Ad5IkappaB-infected cells was increased slightly in untreated cells and almost 3-fold in cells treated with TNF (Fig. 1B). JNK overactivation resulting from NF-kappaB inactivation therefore led to increased AP-1-dependent transcription.",

These results demonstrate that BK stimulates NF-kappaB activation and IL-1beta synthesis in A549 cells, and that RhoA is both necessary and sufficient to mediate this effect.",

A significant lower basal level of MnSOD was detected in DN I?B mutant cells compared with vector control cells. Whereas the levels of MnSOD in vector cells were maintained in hyperoxia up to 2 d, the levels of MnSOD in DN I?B mutant cells were significantly reduced in prolonged hyperoxia (Fig. 5). These results suggest that NF-?B executes its protective role against nonapoptotic cell death in lung epithelial cells by maintaining the levels of MnSOD in hyperoxia.",

It can induce cell death by stabilizing the levels of p53 through activating the ARF tumor suppressor, which suppresses Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53. The p53 protein regulates the transcription of several celldeath genes including BH3-only proteins, proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax and the caspase-9 adaptor Apaf-1. In cells lacking p53, E2F-1 can act through p73, a member of p53 family that activates some of the same target genes as p53. E2F-1 can also directly regulate the transcription of several different caspases and suppress cell survival pathways by suppressing Mcl-1 expression or by inhibiting NFkB-mediated antiapoptotic signaling.",

Fibroblasts treated with medium alone had a diffuse p50 and p65 staining in the cytoplasm, and only weak staining was observed in the nucleus, explaining NF-{kappa}B basal binding observed during EMSA analysis. CSE treatment led to translocation of both subunits observed as increased staining in the nucleus (shown by arrows) and decreased cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 8C). These data support a role for NF-{kappa}B in CSE-induced COX-2 production.",

This led us to examine the effect of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory compound that targets IkB kinase and has insulin-sensitizing effects [32]. Remarkably, aspirin dramatically decreased endotoxin-induced resistin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Both aspirin (via IkB kinase) and rosiglitazone (via PPARg) inhibit NF-kB [31,32], which is activated by LPS. Indeed, treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-kB activation [33], abrogated endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of the macrophages with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF-kB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation [34], nearly abolished endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (Figure 4D). Thus, activation of NF-kB is required for LPS induction of resistin in human macrophages.",

Exposure of these cells to IL-1 beta or overexpression of NF-kappa B cDNAs resulted in a significant increase in the amount of luciferase activity that was diminished greatly in cells transfected with I kappa B alpha, the NF-kappa B inhibitor.",

The cells were subsequently stimulated via CD40 using CHO-CD154 for 16 h. Stimulation of both the wild-type and hCD 32 mutant resulted in a 3-fold induction of NF-kappaB luciferase activity above background, whereas stimulation of the hCD40EEAA mutant did not result in detectable stimulation of NF-kappaB reporter activity (Fig. 9A). Thus, optimal NF-kappaB activation requires an intact TRAF6 binding domain of CD40.",

Increased amounts of p65 supershift band were detected after anti-TCR stimulation in Shn-2–/– T cells. Furthermore, an EMSA with anti-p50 antibody revealed that most of the NF-{kappa}B EMSA band detected in nonstimulated Shn-2–/– T cells contained the p50 subunit (Fig. 4 B, lane 11). There was a substantial increase in the level of the p50 band after anti-TCR stimulation (Fig. 4 B, lane 12). These results suggest that NF-{kappa}B is constitutively activated in Shn-2–/– CD4 T cells and it is hyperactivated after anti-TCR stimulation.",

This led us to examine the effect of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory compound that targets IkB kinase and has insulin-sensitizing effects [32]. Remarkably, aspirin dramatically decreased endotoxin-induced resistin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Both aspirin (via IkB kinase) and rosiglitazone (via PPARg) inhibit NF-kB [31,32], which is activated by LPS. Indeed, treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-kB activation [33], abrogated endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of the macrophages with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF-kB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation [34], nearly abolished endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (Figure 4D). Thus, activation of NF-kB is required for LPS induction of resistin in human macrophages.",

However, the molecular mechanism of this pathway remains unclear. In this report we demonstrate that both NIK and IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) are involved in LTbetaR signaling and that the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit at serine 536 in its transactivation domain 1 (TA1) plays an essential role. We also found that NF-kappaB could be activated in the LTbetaR pathway without altering the level of the phosphorylation of IkappaB and nuclear localization of p65. By using a heterologous transactivation system in which Gal4-dependent reporter gene is activated by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in fusion with various portions of p65, we found that TA1 serves as a direct target in the NIK-IKKalpha pathway. In addition, mutation studies have revealed the essential role of Ser-536 within TA1 of p65 in transcriptional control mediated by NIK-IKKalpha. Furthermore, we found that Ser-536 was phosphorylated following the stimulation of LTbetaR, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by the kinase-dead dominant-negative mutant of either NIK or IKKalpha. These observations provide evidence for a crucial role of the NIK-IKKalpha cascade for NF-kappaB activation in LTbetaR signaling.",

NF-?B activation is known to regulate cellular growth responses, including apoptosis, and is required for the induction of inflammatory and tissue-repair genes, including macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

DNA-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed binding of p300 to several DNA-bound transactivators at basal state. Following stimulation with LPS plus IFN-gamma, binding of p300, p50/p65 NF-kappaB, and IFN-regulatory factor-1 was increased by approximately 2-fold. Nuclear p50 was complexed with and acetylated by p300 at the basal binding state which was increased by LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation. p300 overexpression resulted in increased p50 acetylation which was reduced by HAT mutation. p50 acetylation correlated with increased NF-kappaB binding and enhanced p300 recruitment. Co-overexpression of E1A abolished the augmentation of p50 acetylation and p50 binding induced by p300 overexpression, and a correlative suppression of p300 recruitment to the complex. We conclude that p300 is essential for iNOS transcription. Our results suggest that p300 HAT acetylates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, thereby increasing NF-kappaB binding and NF-kappaB mediated transactivation.",

In the death receptor pathway, ligands such as tumour-necrosis factor (TNF), FAS ligand (also known as CD95L), or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, also known as APO2 ligand (APO2L) or TNF ligand superfamily member 10 (TNFSF10)) interact with their respective death receptors (TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), FAS (also known as CD95) and death receptor 4 (DR4, also known as TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAILR1)) or DR5 (also known as TRAILR2), respectively). These interactions ultimately lead to the recruitment of the FAS-associated death domain (FADD) and the activation of the protease caspase 8. Caspase 8 cleaves and activates caspase 3 and other downstream caspases, which results in a proteolytic cascade that gives rise to the cell death phenotype characterized by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing.",

Muscle loss was due to accelerated protein breakdown through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Expression of the E3 ligase MuRF1, a mediator of muscle atrophy, was increased in MIKK mice. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB/MuRF1 pathway reversed muscle atrophy. Denervation- and tumor-induced muscle loss were substantially reduced and survival rates improved by NF-kappaB inhibition in MISR mice, consistent with a critical role for NF-kappaB in the pathology of muscle wasting and establishing it as an important clinical target for the treatment of muscle atrophy. We show that activation of NF-kappaB, through muscle-specific transgenic expression of activated IkappaB kinase beta (MIKK)... Expression of the E3 ligase MuRF1, a mediator of muscle atrophy, was increased in MIKK mice.",

PARP-1 and p300 synergistically coactivated NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in response to TNFalpha and LPS. Furthermore, PARP-1 interacted directly with p300 and enhanced the interaction of NF-kappaB1/p50 to p300. The C terminus, harboring the catalytic domain of PARP-1 but not its enzymatic activity, was required for complete transcriptional coactivation of NF-kappaB by p300 in response to TNFalpha and LPS. Together, these results indicate that PARP-1 acts synergistically with p300 and plays an essential regulatory role in NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression.",

The first class consists of the VEGF family and the angiopoietins, which specifically act on endothelial cells. The second class contains most direct-acting molecules, including several cytokines, chemokines (157) and angiogenic enzymes (30, 39), which activate a broad range of target cells besides endothelial cells. The prototype member of this group, FGF-2 was one of the first angiogenic peptides to be characterized. The third group of angiogenic molecules includes the indirect-acting factors, whose effect on angiogenesis results from the release of direct-acting factors from macrophages, endothelial or tumor cells. The most extensively studied are tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), which inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. In vivo, TGF-b induces angiogenesis and stimulates the expression of TNF-a, FGF-2, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and VEGF by attracted inflammatory cells (63, 185). TNF-a has been shown to increase the expression of VEGF and its receptors, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and FGF-2 by endothelial cells, thus explaining its angiogenic properties in vivo (87, 261).",

The first class consists of the VEGF family and the angiopoietins, which specifically act on endothelial cells. The second class contains most direct-acting molecules, including several cytokines, chemokines (157) and angiogenic enzymes (30, 39), which activate a broad range of target cells besides endothelial cells. The prototype member of this group, FGF-2 was one of the first angiogenic peptides to be characterized. The third group of angiogenic molecules includes the indirect-acting factors, whose effect on angiogenesis results from the release of direct-acting factors from macrophages, endothelial or tumor cells. The most extensively studied are tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), which inhibit endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. In vivo, TGF-b induces angiogenesis and stimulates the expression of TNF-a, FGF-2, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and VEGF by attracted inflammatory cells (63, 185). TNF-a has been shown to increase the expression of VEGF and its receptors, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and FGF-2 by endothelial cells, thus explaining its angiogenic properties in vivo (87, 261).",

Consistent with a major role for hypoxia in the overall process, a large number of genes involved in different steps of angiogenesis are independently responsive to hypoxia in tissue culture. Examples include nitric oxide synthases involved in governing vascular tone, growth factors such as VEGF, angiopoietins, fibroblast growth factors and their various receptors, and genes involved in matrix metabolism, including matrix metalloproteinases, plasminogen activator receptors and inhibitors, and collagen prolyl hydroxylase16, 17, 18, 19, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61 (Table 1). Similarly, many of the individual phenotypic processes in angiogenesis such as cell migration or endothelial tube formation can be induced by hypoxic tissue culture62, 63, 64. These analyses in isolated systems have sometimes apparently shown both positive and negative effects of hypoxia, for instance on endothelial proliferation65, 66, 67. It is not yet clear whether such phenomena reflect fundamentally different responses based on severity of hypoxia, or counter-regulatory controls that are normally integrated in a productive way.",

The death rate of A549 cells increased with increasing concentration of TNF (Fig. 1b), and cell death was characterized by cytoplasmic condensation and pyknotic nuclei without apoptotic body formation (Fig. 1c). Dose-dependent release of LDH into the culture medium was also noted (Fig. 1d); this is frequently encountered after necrotic cell death due to rupture of the cell membrane....Thus, TNF triggers necrotic rather than apoptotic cell death in A549 cells.",

In this study, we used the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 as a cell model to study endothelial cell adherence. As shown in Figure 10, thrombin or tryptase stimulation of lung endothelial cells isolated from WT mice resulted in a 4-fold increase in RAW cell adherence. Pretreatment with BEL inhibited RAW cell adherence after either tryptase or thrombin stimulation. In contrast, stimulation of lung endothelial cells from iPLA2β-KOmice with thrombin or tryptase failed to increase RAW cell adherence to the endothelial cell monolayer (Figure 10). These results are consistent with a requirement for iPLA2β in thrombin and tryptase-stimulated endothelial cell PAF production and inflammatory cell adherence.",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

              "summary_text": "Interestingly, the presence of two additional basic amino acids 6 and 7 residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation site in certain peptide substrates allows phosphorylation by CaMKI/IV equally well with or without activation by a CaMKK (14). This \\\"activation independence\\\" has not yet been demonstrated toward protein substrates. Nonetheless, because CaMKI/IV requires Ca2+/CaM for deinhibition in addition to activation loop phosphorylation, substrates of this type would not be phosphorylated by CaMKI/IV until a Ca2+ signal was initiated and so could represent Ca2+-dependent but activation-independent signaling targets. Subsequent activation by a CaMKK would increase the number of available substrates by enhancing CaMKI/IV activity toward a second set of substrates (Fig. 1).   Does the Cascade Function in Cells? TOP INTRODUCTION Identification and Biochemical... Does the Cascade Function... Is the Cascade Physiologic? Other Transcriptional Targets... Evidence for a CaMK... REFERENCES  The first reconstruction of a CaMK cascade in cells used transient transfection experiments with CREB as the transcriptional target. CaMKI and CaMKIV phosphorylate CREB on its activating Ser-133 in vitro and stimulate Gal4-CREB-dependent transcription in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ when cells are cotransfected with Gal4-CREB and a Gal4 reporter gene (15). Additional cotransfection with a CaMKK increases reporter activity more than 10-fold (8, 9). Mutation of the CaMKIV activation loop T to A abolishes CaMKK enhancement.  To be a signaling cascade, kinase activation loop phosphorylation must be dependent upon induction of CaMKK activity. Phosphate incorporation into endogenous CaMKIV in Jurkat cells is induced rapidly following T-cell receptor stimulation and is blocked by chelation of extracellular Ca2+. This is accompanied by 8-14-fold increases in immunoprecipitated CaMKIV activity that is refractory to further activation by exogenous CaMKK and can be reversed by in vitro treatment with PP2A (16). Recombinant CaMKIV transfected into BJAB cells, which lack endogenous CaMKIV, demonstrates similar activation following anti-IgM stimulation that is abrogated by mutating the activation loop T to A (4). Likewise, CaMKI phosphorylation is induced in PC12 cells, coincident with increased CaMKI activity and reduced activation of CaMKI by exogenous CaMKK (17). Collectively, these experiments provide strong evidence for an inducible, Ca2+-dependent activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV in intact cells via activation loop phosphorylation. However, the fact that activation loop phosphorylation requires Ca2+ does not confirm that the physiologic activator is itself Ca2+-dependent, because Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKI or CaMKIV is required before these enzymes can be phosphorylated by the known CaMKKs.  The issue of subcellular localization is a confounding one for any model of the CaMK cascade regulating transcription. There are several lines of evidence that CaMKK and - are both cytoplasmic. In contrast to an early study using a polyclonal antibody, immunohistochemistry of rat brain slices using monoclonal antibodies able to distinguish between the  and  isoforms found exclusively cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for both (18). Furthermore, green fluorescent protein-tagged CaMKK and - are cytoplasmic in NG108 cells even after depolarizing stimulation (18). This holds true for overexpressed CaMKK in Jurkat and BJAB cells.2 Similarly, CaMKI appears to be excluded from the nucleus in brain slices as well as in cells overexpressing the protein, yet CaMKI immunoreactivity has recently been observed to translocate to the nuclei of hippocampal neurons during long term potentiation (19, 20).3 In contrast, CaMKIV is predominantly nuclear but can also be found in neuronal soma and dendritic processes, where it could interact with a cytoplasmic CaMKK (21).  The CaMK cascade then is well positioned to affect cytoplasmic e...",

Treatment of this spontaneous melanoma with the Akt inhibitor resulted in significant decreases in 3 genes that may account for this resistance. Sirt1 is a deacetylase that attenuates p53 in the presence of oxidative stress; rictor is a rapamycin-insensitive member of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex; and VEGF is likely the major angiogenic factor in melanoma. Inhibition of Akt led to significant and reproducible decreases in the mRNA levels of all 3 genes.  .... Note: if they didnt not use an inhibitor to verify AKT action, I coded to expression of AKT.

However, we observed cooperative effects of RAF and AKT on the expression of two key cell cycle regulators, cyclin D1 and p27Kip1. Activation of AKT or RAF alone led to a two- or threefold induction of cyclin D1 expression, respectively (Fig. 2A).",

Upon growth factor stimulation, Akt is activated, directly phosphorylating FKHRL1 at T32 and S253, and to a lesser extent at S315, and resulting in FKHRL1 relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ....  Similar AKT-dependent changes in subcellular localization have also been observed for the additional FKHRL1 human homologs AFX and FKHR.... Phosphorylation at T32 and S253 causes FKHRL1 to bind to 14-3-3, suggesting that the interaction between FKHRL1 and 14-3-3 may play an important role in regulating the subcellular localization of the complex.",

We found that SU5402 and LY294002 significantly reduced Elf5 expression, whereas U0126 had no effect. LY294002 also reduced Elf5 expression in cultures of purified epithelium. Finally, pAkt was coexpressed with Elf5 in the proximal epithelial airways of E17.5 lungs. These results demonstrate that Elf5 is an FGF-sensitive transcription factor in the lung with a dynamic pattern of expression and that FGF regulation of Elf5 by means of FGFR2b occurs through the PI3-Kinase/Akt pathway.",

Because FAK binds PI 3-kinase, the protective effect against anoikis may be the result of PI 3-kinase-mediated activation of protein kinase B/Akt (52). Akt promotes survival, at least in part, by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating two proapoptotic proteins, Bad and caspase-9 (53) (Fig. 4). Inhibition of p53 prevents FAKdeficient cells from undergoing anoikis when deprived of growth factors, suggesting that p53 mediates the death signal under FAK deficiency (51).",

Akt, Singly Phosphorylated at Thr308, Remains Active and Functional in Response to Growth Factor Stimulation in SIN1-/- Cells Since Akt Thr308 phosphorylation was not dependent on Ser473 phosphorylation in SIN1-/- cells, we then asked whether this Thr308 singly phosphorylated Akt is still active and whether lack of Ser473 phosphorylation would have a global effect on the phosphorylation of Akt targets. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that Akt retained a substantial amount of enzymatic activity in SIN1-/- cells, although lower than that in wild-type cells (Figure 3B).

This results in inhibition of Akt activation (pAkt), which may be involved in the growth inhibitory responses seen with PPAR? activation. Decreased Akt activity also can lead to decreased activity of the transcription factor NF-?B. NF-?B is a critical transcription factor in the production of proangiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, IL-8. Decreased production of these factors would be expected to inhibit recruitment of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, and block tumor angiogenesis. PPAR?-mediated suppression of members of the Snail family of transcription factors, such as Snail, Zeb, or Twist, would lead to derepression of E-cadherin expression and promote the epithelial phenotype, leading to decreased migration and invasiveness. PPAR?-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression in NSCLC has been shown by several investigators. This would result in decreased PGE2 production, which will impact growth. TZDs can inhibit PGE2 production through a PPAR?-independent pathway involving induction of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). (Figure 2 full text)",

This leads to the autophosphorylation of Kit on tyrosine and its association with substrates of various kinds. The phophatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt system is one of the major pathways [33] (fig. 1). PI3K is composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. The 85-kDa regulatory subunit is associated with activated Kit through an SH2 domain, and then is phosphorylated on tyrosine. The 110-kDa catalytic subunit of the activated PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, which in turn is used for phosphorylation of Akt, a serine-threonine kinase. The activated Akt is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis of cells whose survival depends on Kit signaling. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate blocks not only autophosphorylation of Kit but also phosphorylation of Akt [34]. Induction of apoptosis in Kit signaling-dependent cells by imatinib mesylate may be mediated through the inhibition of Akt activity.",

Insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis both by inactivating GSK3 and also by promoting the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase. The inactivation of GSK3 and GSK3 is achieved through phosphorylation of Ser21 and Ser9, respectively [12], and this is mediated by PKB in a PI3K-dependent fashion. Thus PI3K, PDK, PKB and GSK3 constitute one important arm of the insulin signalling cascade regulating glycogen synthesis. In addition to inducing an increase in glucose transport, over-expression of PKB elicited an inhibition of GSK3 and a concomitant increase in glycogen and protein synthesis a decrease in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, glucose transport and membrane ruffling, which coincided with reduced phosphorylation of PKB and p70S6K but normal phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK observed an inhibition of PKB phosphorylation and downstream p70S6K activation, which was attributable to a PP2A-type phosphatase activity Akt phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3, decreasing the rate of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase",

For example, integrin- airlinked kinase (ILK) activation is inhibited by blockade of Akt function (Persad et al., 2000), and PTEN interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and influences cell migration (Tamura et al., 1999). These interactions affect cell survival, an event influenced by both VEGF and integrins. Also, cell migration and angiogenesis are reg- ulated by Akt and PTEN, and these cellular responses are clearly mediated by integrins (Jiang et al., 2000). By overexpression approaches, we have directly impli- cated Akt and PTEN in the pathway from VEGF to integ- rin activation. Thus, some of the functions of PI 3-kinase, Akt, and PTEN in cell migration may depend upon their role in integrin activation, and engagement of VEGFR2",

The homologous site in protein kinase B (PKB), Thr308, has been shown to be phosphorylated by the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase PDK1. A regulatory link between p70s6k and PKB was demonstrated, as PDK1 was found to selectively phosphorylate p70s6k at Thr229. More importantly, PDK1 activated p70s6k in vitro and in vivo, whereas the catalytically inactive PDK1 blocked insulin-induced activation of p70s6k.",

Polyhistidine-tagged Akt or dominant-negative mutant Akt (dnAkt)-transfected clones were generated from HPL-V12 cells. The success of the gene transfections was confirmed by Western blotting for Akt and the polyhistidine tag (His) (Figure 3a) . The dnAkt-transfected HPL-V12 cells (V12/dnAkt) showed significant reductions of the autonomous migration by about 50% compared to the mock-transfected HPL-V12 cells (V12/Emp), while Akt-transfected HPL-V12 cells (V12/Akt) showed increased levels of migration compared to V12/Emp cells ",

Plasmin mediates invasion directly, by degrading matrix proteins such as collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin, or indirectly, by activating matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2, -3, and -9 and serine protease uPA [9-12]. uPA exerts its nonproteolytic activity through its interaction with uPA receptor (uPAR), which forms the complex with integrins and controls cell adhesion and cell migration [",

These results indicate that in addition to the previously reported activation of proMMP-1 (tissue procollagenase) and proMMP-8 (neutrophil procollagenase), MMP-10 can also activate proMMP-9 and proMMP-7, and suggest the possibility that MMP-10 may replace a role of MMP-3 in the ECM degradation in concert with other MMP under various pathological conditions.",

When exposed to cigarette smoke for 2–3 days, MMP-12-null mice had an attenuated number of lung neutrophils and decreased expression of MIP-2, MIP-1{alpha}, and MMP-9 activity in BAL, suggesting that the MMP-9 response is dependent almost entirely on MMP-12 expression (180).
