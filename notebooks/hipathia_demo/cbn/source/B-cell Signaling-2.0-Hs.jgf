The network includes key components involved in the class switching process frequently observed during COPD development, which may contribute to the generation of an autoimmune component underlying disease progression.",

If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

Microbial-activated TL1A was in part mediated by TLR 1, 2, 4, and 9 signaling pathways and dependent on downstream p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1) [46]. Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis. Our group showed that TLR8 or TLR7/8 ligand (R848) can inhibit TL1A production in a dose dependent manner [47•].",

              "summary_text": "BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cells home to bone by means of chemo-attraction to marrow chemokines, and interaction of chemokines with their receptors leads to the expression/activation of adhesion molecules and proteases. Recent evidence suggests that similar mechanisms may be active in cancer metastasis. Previously, we showed that metalloproteases (MMPs), and in particular MMP-9, play a role in prostate cancer (PC) expansion in bone. METHODS: We used a variety of methods including RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, gelatin zymography, cellular motility and invasion, and subcellular fractionation of PC cells applied to in vivo and in vitro models. RESULTS: Here we showed that (a) CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is expressed in PC bone metastasis; (b) exogenous CXCL12 induced MMP-9 expression by PC cells; (c) bone stromal cells and bone tissue conditioned media induced the migration of PC cells in a CXCR4-dependent manner; (d) pharmacological inhibition of PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathways abrogated CXCL12-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion of PC cells; (e) exogenous CXCL12 induced Akt1 phosphorylation is indispensable for proMMP-9 secretion, migration, and invasion of PC cells; (f) CXCR4 was localized to lipid rafts in PC cells and initiated Akt phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that chemoattractive mechanisms involve migration of cancer cells towards bone tissue, and that cell signaling induced by binding of the chemokine to its receptor leads to the activation of multiple signaling pathways and subsequent secretion of MMP-9 into the local environment. These findings provide a link between chemoattractive mechanisms, growth of tumor cells in bone, and tumor-enhanced bone matrix turnover.",

The cells were subsequently stimulated via CD40 using CHO-CD154 for 16 h.

At the present, there is no study reporting phosphorylation/activation of NIK under ischemic conditions. This study provided the first evidence that p-NIK was up-regulated in the ischemic cortex, indicating that NIK is activated by cerebral ischemic insults. Furthermore, GKAB could suppress the phosphorylation/activation of NIK. Taken together, these results suggest that GKAB may inhibit ischemia-induced NF-kappaB activation by IkappaBalpha degradation via suppression of the NIK-IKK pathway.",

We also provide evidence that APE/Ref-1 can modulate the cooperative activation of the blk promoter operated by Pax5a and EBF and that APE/Ref-1 might directly regulate EBF functional activity. Finally, we show that the interaction between Pax5a and EBF enhances EBF binding activity to its consensus sequence, suggesting that Pax5a can physically interact with EBF and modulate its DNA binding activity.",

Moreover, neutrophil recruitment in a model of thioglycollate-induced peritonitis is impaired in CD40-deficient mice. In vitro data revealed that CD40 deficiency blocked CD40L-induced NF-kB p65 nuclear translocation in leukocytes. Altogether, our data identified for the first time that CD40 is essential in the upregulation of TRAF6, NF-kB activation, and NF-kB-dependent proinflammatory genes in vivo. ",

The activities of these proteins are tightly controlled during cell adhesion to the ECM (Hynes, 2002Go; Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002Go). For example, Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion and, via specific effectors, stimulate the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex leading to actin polymerisation and lamellipodia and filopodia formation at the leading edge of cells",

Additional complexity in the system is provided by the contribution of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family, downstream effectors of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Isoforms PAK1 and PAK2 have both been shown to phosphorylate smooth muscle MLCK and decrease MLCK activity in cultured cells (61, 123), but whether PAK regulates the high-molecular-mass MLCK present in endothelium in this fashion is not clear. Conversely, PAK2 can directly phosphorylate MLC to produce EC contraction (163).",

Activation of the p38 MAPK cascade in Jurkat T cells has been shown to require phosphorylation of the GEF Vav by Zap-70 and subsequent activation of Rac-1. CD28 co-stimulation augments the recruitment of Vav to LAT and Zap-70 and increases Zap-70 mediated Vav phosphorylation [23].

Using recombinant Rho GTPases and LyGDI, we demonstrate that PLCbeta2 is stimulated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S])-activated Cdc42HsxLyGDI, but not by RhoAxLyGDI. Stimulation of PLCbeta2, which was also observed for GTP[S]-activated recombinant Rac1, was independent of LyGDI, but required C-terminal processing of Cdc42Hs/Rac1.

In addition, the inner surfaces of the pinocytosed membranes contain F-actin (Greenberg, 1995; Davis and Camarillo, 1996; Cardelli, 2001) (Fig. 11). Recent work has elucidated some of the molecular components involved in the cytoskeletal signaling pathways regulating macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. In both cases, Rho GTPases regulate these events. Rac and Cdc42 GTPases have been found to be required for macropinocytosis (Cardelli, 2001; Ridley, 2001a) and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis (Caron and Hall, 1998).

The results revealed that CXCL12-promoted migration of DN Rac or Vav1 SH3-SH2-SH3 transfectants was substantially lower than that displayed by transfectants expressing wt Rac, Vav1, or Cdc42, or DN Cdc42 (Figure 8Figure 8.).

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Mast cells are the major effector cell type in IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity. Traditionally, it is thought that mast cells bound to Ag-specific Fc?RI, so-called sensitized mast cells, encounter multivalent Ag, and then IgE-bound receptors are aggregated or cross-linked, leading to cell activation (1). Activated mast cells secrete preformed and newly synthesized proinflammatory mediators involved in inflammatory processes of allergy, such as histamine, proteases, lipids, cytokines, and chemokines. The mouse Fc?RI consists of an IgE-binding ? subunit, a signal-amplifying {beta} subunit, and disulfide-bonded two molecules of signal-generating ? subunit (2). Fc?RI aggregation leads to the activation of {beta} subunit-bound Lyn, a prominent Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)3 in mast cells (3). Lyn phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs of the {beta} and ? subunits (4). Phosphorylated ITAMs of {beta} and ? subunits, respectively, recruit Lyn and Syk, a member of another PTK family with two tandemly arranged Src homology 2 domains, leading to the activation of these PTKs. Active Lyn and Syk phosphorylate numerous cellular target proteins, leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K and phospholipase C (PLC)-?. An alternative pathway involving Fyn (another Src family PTK) was shown to activate PI3K (5). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, i.e., diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and then Ca2+ influx. Increased DAG and Ca2+ lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (reviewed in Ref. 6). Both PKC and Ca2+ are required for optimal degranulation (7). ",

Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Strong SH3P7 phosphorylation was obtained with all three PTKs (lanes 6 to 8). After phosphorylation by Syk and Lyn, a phosphoprotein was detected which migrates slightly above the 55-kDa protein band of SH3P7 (lanes 6 and 7). This upper band is likely to be a differently phosphorylated form of SH3P7, because a similar protein doublet was recognized by anti-SH3P7 antibodies (compare Fig. ?Fig.3a,3a, lanes 6 and 8)",

The identification of N-myc target genes is an important step for understanding N-Myc biological functions in both physiological and pathological contexts. In this study, we describe the identification of N-Myc-responsive genes through chromatin immunoprecipitation and methylation-sensitive restriction analysis. Results show that N-Myc is a direct regulator of several identified genes, and that methylation of the CpG dinucleotide within the E-box prevents the access of N-Myc to gene promoters in vivo. Furthermore, methylation profile of the E-box within the promoters of EGFR and CASP8, two genes directly controlled by Myc, is cell type-specific, suggesting that differential E-box methylation may contribute to generating unique patterns of Myc-dependent transcription. This study illuminates a central role of DNA methylation in controlling N-Myc occupancy at gene promoters and modulating its transcriptional activity in cancer cells.",

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

These findings were correlated with decreased expression of genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 3gamma, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and retinoid X receptor.% These results indicate that c- myc overexpression may counteract diabetic changes by controlling hepatic glucose metabolism, both directly by altering the expression of metabolic genes and through the expression of key transcription factor genes.",

These facts are consistent with a model in which Mxi1-Max heterodimers indirectly inhibit Myc function in two ways: first, by sequestering Max, thus preventing the formation of Myc-Max heterodimers, and second, by competing with Myc-Max heterodimers for binding to target sites.",

MYC is a member of the MYC/MAX/MAD network of the basic region/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (bHLHZ) domain transcriptional regulators (for a summary of the domain structure see Fig. 1). MYC proteins form obligatory heterodimers with MAX, and these complexes bind to specific E-box DNA sequences with the consensus 5beta-CACGTG (7). The transactivation domain (TAD) is localized at theNterminus, containing two highly conserved elements, Myc box (MB) I and II, that are particularly relevant for MYC regulation and cofactor recruitment, respectively (Fig. 1). Within the MYC/MAX/MAD network, MYC proteins are antagonized by several bHLHZ proteins collectively referred to as MAD proteins (for an overview of the network see Fig. S2A) (8).",

These results indicate that the degradation of p27 is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: translocation-coupled cytoplasmic ubiquitylation by KPC at the G0 G1 transition and nuclear ubiquitylation by SKP2 during S and G2 phases (see Supplementary information S2 (figure)). Given that, in a subset of breast cancers (32 out of 84 samples)45, p27 levels were low despite SKP2 not being expressed, it remains possible that the expression of KPC might be elevated in such cases. Surprisingly, SKP2 also binds to MYC through its MB2 and helix loop helix leucine zipper (HLHZip) domains, and thereby mediates its ubiquitylation and degradation. However, SKP2 unexpectedly increases the transactivation activity of MYC, indicating that SKP2 is a transcriptional cofactor. Consistent with this notion, MYC accumulates, but its transcriptional activity is reduced, in mouse Skp2 ko cells.",

We now show that Myc is bound to the cyclin D2 promoter in vivo. Binding of Myc induces cyclin D2 expression and histone acetylation at a single nucleosome in a MycBoxII/TRRAP-dependent manner. Down-regulation of cyclin D2 mRNA expression in differentiating HL60 cells is preceded by a switch of promoter occupancy from Myc/Max to Mad/Max complexes, loss of TRRAP binding, increased HDAC1 binding, and histone deacetylation. Thus, recruitment of TRRAP and regulation of histone acetylation are critical for transcriptional activation by Myc.",

In addition, glucose augmented the binding of ChREBP, c-Myc, and Max to the promoter of the L-PK gene in situ.  #[JL] Chrebp is MLXIPL, and is implicated as a glucose-responsive factor.

As Src-family kinases activate the PI 3-kinase pathway in many cells [1], it is possible that the overexpression of Src, Lyn or Lck in HEK-293 cells induces the activation of PI 3-kinase, thereby promoting DAPP1 phosphorylation in unstimulated cells. As Src-family tyrosine kinases are located at the plasma membrane by virtue of myristoylation and palmitoylation of their N-termini [26], it is likely that the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is to recruit DAPP1 to the cell membrane, where it can be phosphorylated with Src-family tyrosine kinases.",

Phosphorylation of Y1105, but not the minor site, was modulated in vivo to a greater extent by overexpression of c-Src than by the EGF receptor and was efficiently catalyzed by c-Src in vitro, indicating that Y1105 is a selective and preferential target of c-Src both in vitro and in vivo.

As Src-family kinases activate the PI 3-kinase pathway in many cells [1], it is possible that the overexpression of Src, Lyn or Lck in HEK-293 cells induces the activation of PI 3-kinase, thereby promoting DAPP1 phosphorylation in unstimulated cells. As Src-family tyrosine kinases are located at the plasma membrane by virtue of myristoylation and palmitoylation of their N-termini [26], it is likely that the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is to recruit DAPP1 to the cell membrane, where it can be phosphorylated with Src-family tyrosine kinases.",

              "summary_text": "One of the prominent effects of the Src kinase is to reduce cell adhesion. The small GTPase, R-Ras, affects cell adhesion by maintaining integrin activity, and the ability of R-Ras to do so can be regulated by phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue located in its effector domain by an Eph receptor kinase (Zou, J. X., Wang, B., Kalo, M. S., Zisch, A. H., Pasquale, E. B., and Ruoslahti, E. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 13813-13818). Here we show that Src regulates cell adhesion through R-Ras and integrins. Reduced substrate attachment of 293T cells transfected with the cDNA for an activated form of Src (v-Src) was accompanied by phosphorylation of endogenous R-Ras. v-Src also phosphorylated R-Ras in vitro. An activated form of Src similar to one that has been found in human cancers, Src527, shared with v-Src the ability to phosphorylate R-Ras. Stronger R-Ras phosphorylation was seen in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells cells transformed with temperature-sensitive v-Src at the permissive temperature than at the non-permissive temperature, and R-Ras and Src co-immunoprecipitated at the permissive temperature. Mutation analysis showed that the Src phosphorylation site in R-Ras was tyrosine 66, the position critical to the ability of R-Ras to support integrin activity. Finally, activated R-Ras in which tyrosine 66 is mutated to phenylalanine rendered cells partially resistant to the effects of Src on cell adhesion. Regulation of cell adhesion by Src through R-Ras may be at least partially responsible for the reduced adhesion and the resulting increased invasiveness of Src-transformed cells.",

At a concentration of 10 ?M PP1, a 69% and 60% inhibition of omeprazole- and TCDD-mediated Gal4?AhR activation were obtained, respectively (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the Gal4?AhR activation caused by omeprazole or TCDD was blocked by 58% and 57%, respectively, at 10 ?M PP2. Comparable results were also obtained in human hepatoma HepG2 cells, demonstrating that the effect of the pyrazolopyrimidines on AhR signalling was not limited to H4IIE cells (Fig. 2B). .......We next examined the effect of expression of a dominant-negative src cDNA (DN-src) on Gal4–AhR activation. Cotransfection of H4IIE cells with DN-src and Gal4–AhR vectors and subsequent stimulation with omeprazole or TCDD revealed a decrease in luciferase activity that inversely correlated to the amount of DN-src expression vector added to the cells (Fig. 3A).

Eight sites were identified by direct mutation of candidate tyrosines to phenylalanine and elimination of the accompanying spots on the two-dimensional maps. Identical sites were observed in vitro and in vivo, strongly suggesting that the physiologically important sites have been correctly identified. (Next section taken from Results - Fig 4) Mutation of tyrosines 112, 228, and 280 to phenylalanine resulted in elimination of phosphopeptide spots 6, 7, and 8, respectively. Mutation of tyrosine 96 eliminated spots 9 and 10, whereas mutation of tyrosine 257 eliminated spots 4 and 5...These results suggest that peptides 1, 2, and 3 represent singly, doubly, and triply phosphorylated variants, respectively, of the same peptide, containing Tyr291, Tyr296, and Tyr302.

As Src-family kinases activate the PI 3-kinase pathway in many cells [1], it is possible that the overexpression of Src, Lyn or Lck in HEK-293 cells induces the activation of PI 3-kinase, thereby promoting DAPP1 phosphorylation in unstimulated cells. As Src-family tyrosine kinases are located at the plasma membrane by virtue of myristoylation and palmitoylation of their N-termini [26], it is likely that the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is to recruit DAPP1 to the cell membrane, where it can be phosphorylated with Src-family tyrosine kinases.",

              "summary_text": "Mast cells are the major effector cell type in IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity. Traditionally, it is thought that mast cells bound to Ag-specific Fc?RI, so-called sensitized mast cells, encounter multivalent Ag, and then IgE-bound receptors are aggregated or cross-linked, leading to cell activation (1). Activated mast cells secrete preformed and newly synthesized proinflammatory mediators involved in inflammatory processes of allergy, such as histamine, proteases, lipids, cytokines, and chemokines. The mouse Fc?RI consists of an IgE-binding ? subunit, a signal-amplifying {beta} subunit, and disulfide-bonded two molecules of signal-generating ? subunit (2). Fc?RI aggregation leads to the activation of {beta} subunit-bound Lyn, a prominent Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)3 in mast cells (3). Lyn phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs of the {beta} and ? subunits (4). Phosphorylated ITAMs of {beta} and ? subunits, respectively, recruit Lyn and Syk, a member of another PTK family with two tandemly arranged Src homology 2 domains, leading to the activation of these PTKs. Active Lyn and Syk phosphorylate numerous cellular target proteins, leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K and phospholipase C (PLC)-?. An alternative pathway involving Fyn (another Src family PTK) was shown to activate PI3K (5). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, i.e., diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and then Ca2+ influx. Increased DAG and Ca2+ lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (reviewed in Ref. 6). Both PKC and Ca2+ are required for optimal degranulation (7). ",

Among the p160/steroid receptor co-activators, only p/CIP (nuclear co-activator 3) has been shown to be up-regulated by interleukin (IL)-4 in B cells through a STAT-6-dependent mechanism using Gene-Chip analysis. In this study, we have investigated the function of p/CIP in the transcriptional activation by STAT6. We found that p/CIP indirectly interacted with STAT6 via p300, and overexpression of the CBP-interacting domain of p/CIP (p/CIP(947-1084)) prevented the interaction of p/CIP with STAT6 by blocking the binding of p/CIP to p300. Whereas expression of p/CIP(947-1084) resulted in a marked reduction of STAT6-mediated transactivation, overexpression of wild type p/CIP resulted in significant enhancement of it. In addition, p/CIP(947-1084) markedly reduced CD23 expression on B cells stimulated with IL-4, whereas overexpression of wild type p/CIP enhanced it. Chromatin immunoprecipitations demonstrate that IL-4 increases the interaction of p/CIP with the murine immunoglobulin heavy chain germ line epsilon promoter in B cells. These results suggest that p/CIP positively regulates STAT6 transcriptional activation through formation of a STAT6, p300/CBP, and p/CIP complex.",

Furthermore, the rate of loss of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat6 in cells expressing a mutation of the human IL-4 receptor alpha in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif sequence (Y5F) was dramatically decreased compared with wild-type cells. The early rate of decay was similar in the presence or absence of MG132, an inhibitor of the proteasome, but the later rate of decay was decreased 5-fold.

IL-13 receptor activation leads to STAT6 activation and consequent induction of CLCA1 gene expression. The CLCA1 protein is secreted as N-terminal and C-terminal CLCA1 (N-CLCA1 and C-CLCA1) peptide fragments that might activate a putative CLCA1 receptor and in turn MAPK13 to drive a consequent increase in mucin (especially MUC5AC) gene expression and mucus production in airway mucous cells.",

To further characterize IL-4 effects on B cells, we used a sensitive PCR-based subtraction approach to isolate genes expressed in IL-4 treated cells. Our approach combined an adaptation of the genomic representational difference analysis (RDA) method to cDNA analysis with a physical separation method (magnetic bead depletion). This cDNA RDA technique allowed us to perform subtraction on the relatively small number of highly, characterized, purified B cells that can be conveniently prepared. In the hopes of removing genes responsible for general cell growth, we subtracted cDNA made from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated B cells from cDNA from LPS+IL-4 stimulated B cells. Two rounds of subtraction resulted in greater than 100-fold enhancement of expected IL-4-induced Cgamma1 cDNA. At that point, we cloned this subtraction library and analysed 154 randomly picked clones for sequence similarities. From these clones, 37 individual genes were obtained. Most of these genes (30) could be functionally identified by sequence similarity. These included genes encoding Cgamma1 (1), cytoskeletal components (4) and products involved in DNA replication (3), metabolism (5), signal transduction (4), transcription (4), translation (6) and transport (3). Only 7 genes had no similarity to known sequences in the GenBank, EMBL or Swiss Prot databases. One unknown gene (designated Fig1 for IL-Four Induced Gene 1) and one gene with homology to the human transcription factor E4BP4 were confirmed by Northern blot analysis to be induced 10-20-fold by IL-4 treatment. This list of expressed genes in LPS + IL-4 treated B cells may shed further insight on the action and mechanism of IL-4 stimulation of cells.",

Cbp is located exclusively in so-called lipid rafts in which cholesterol, glycosphingolipid, and a variety of membrane-anchored signaling molecules including SFK accumulate. Lipid rafts are thus viewed as platforms for signaling across the membrane. The interaction of Cbp with Csk is also dependent upon the phosphorylation of its Tyr-314 by SFK (8-10). Based on these lines of evidence, a model of feedback regulation of SFK has been presented according to which activation of SFK by an extracellular stimulus leads to the phosphorylation of Cbp; this results in recruitment of Csk to lipid rafts and is followed by termination of SFK function (11-13).",

As Src-family kinases activate the PI 3-kinase pathway in many cells [1], it is possible that the overexpression of Src, Lyn or Lck in HEK-293 cells induces the activation of PI 3-kinase, thereby promoting DAPP1 phosphorylation in unstimulated cells. As Src-family tyrosine kinases are located at the plasma membrane by virtue of myristoylation and palmitoylation of their N-termini [26], it is likely that the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is to recruit DAPP1 to the cell membrane, where it can be phosphorylated with Src-family tyrosine kinases.",

Interestingly, Ser-695 appears to be required to trigger further phosphorylation events at adjacent Thr-692 and Thr-703 residues, which also participate in the mobility shift.

Csk was also activated by a phosphopeptide containing the tyrosine in Cbp that binds to Csk (Tyr-314). Kinetic analysis revealed that Cbp or the phosphopeptide induced up to a 6-fold reduction in the K(m) for Src, indicating that the Csk.Cbp complex has a greater affinity for Src than free Csk. These findings suggest that Cbp is involved in the regulation of SFKs not only by relocating Csk to the membrane but also by directly activating Csk.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Extensive data indicate that oncoproteins, such as oncogenic H-Ras, initiate signal transduction cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of specific transcription factors. We and others have previously demonstrated that Ras activates the inherent transcriptional activation function of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Supportive of the importance of NF-kappaB in transformation, Ras-induced cellular transformation can be suppressed by expression of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or by dominant-negative forms of the upstream activator IkappaB kinase (IKK). However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

However, downstream signaling pathways activated by non-bacterial agonists are not known. Thus, we determined the downstream signaling pathways derived from saturated fatty acid-induced TLR4 activation. Saturated fatty acid (lauric acid)-induced NFkB activation was inhibited by a dominant negative (DN) mutant of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF6, or IkBa in macrophages (RAW264.7) and 293T cells transfected with TLR4 and MD-2. Lauric acid induced the transient phosphorylation of AKT. LY294002, PI3K(DN), or AKT(DN) inhibited NFkB activation, p65 transactivation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression induced by lauric acid or constitutively active (CA) TLR4. AKT(DN) blocked MyD88-induced NFkB activation suggesting that AKT is a MyD88-dependent downstream signaling component of TLR4. AKT(CA) was sufficient to induce NFkB activation and COX-2 expression. These results demonstrate that NFkB activation and COX-2 expression induced by lauric acid is at least partly mediated through TLR4/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In contrast, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT induced by LPS or lauric acid. DHA also suppressed NFkB activation induced by TLR4(CA), but not MyD88(CA) or AKT(CA) suggesting that the molecular targets of DHA are signaling components upstream of MyD88 and AKT. Together, these results suggest that saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids reciprocally modulate the activation of TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathways involving MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 and PI3K/AKT, and further suggest a possibility that TLR4-mediated target gene expression and cellular responses are also differentially modulated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.",

Cse4p has a unique 135-amino-acid N terminus and a C-terminal histone-fold domain that is more than 60% identical to histone H3 and the mammalian centromere protein CENP-A. Cse4p and CENP-A have biochemical properties similar to H3 and probably replace H3 in centromere-specific nucleosomes in yeasts and mammals, respectively. In order to identify regions of Cse4p that distinguish it from H3 and confer centromere function, a systematic site-directed mutational analysis was performed. Nested deletions of the Cse4p N terminus showed that this region of the protein contains at least one essential domain. The C-terminal histone-fold domain of Cse4p was analyzed by changing Cse4p amino acids that differ between Cse4p and H3 to the analogous H3 residues. Extensive substitution of contiguous Cse4p residues with H3 counterparts resulted in cell lethality. However, all large lethal substitution alleles could be subdivided into smaller viable alleles, many of which caused elevated rates of mitotic chromosome loss. The results indicate that residues critical for wild-type Cse4p function and high-fidelity chromosome transmission are distributed across the entire histone-fold domain. Our findings are discussed in the context of the known structure of H3 within the nucleosome and compared with previous results reported for CENP-A.",

This data establishes the IL-12 p35 gene as a new target of c-Rel and shows that the regulation of IL-12 p70 expression at the transcriptional level by Rel/NF-kappaB is controlled through both the p35 and p40 genes in a cell type-specific fashion.",

              "summary_text": "The members of this family share a region of homology that spans the first 300 N-terminal amino acids known as the NF- k-B/Rel/dorsal region or Rel homology domain; it is responsible for dimerization, DNA binding, and nuclear translocation of NFk- B (Fig. 2) [211, 408-411]. The Rel homology domain consists of three regions, including a nuclear localization sequence, a DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization region [405]. Functional NF- kB is composed of dimers formed from p50, p52, Rel A (p65), Rel B, and c-Rel proteins [412-414]. In unstimulated cells, the nuclear localization sequence of NF-kB is bound to inhibitory proteins (IkB), thus maintaining it in the cytosol [415]. IkB proteins include IkBa [416] IkBb [417], IkBg [418,419], and possibly Bcl-3 [420,421]. Interestingly, the proteins previously believed to be precursor proteins of p50 and p52 known as p105 [422,423] and p100 [424] also exhibit IkB activity [424-426]. Recently, it was found that both p105 and p50 are generated from the same transcript but that the p105 protein is not actually a precursor of p50 [427]. The best studied of the IkB proteins is IkBa. Stimulation of cells leads to hyperphosphorylation of IkBaserines 32 and 36 [428-431] via activation of Nik, which phosphorylates IkB kinase (Fig. 2) [432-434]. Phosphorylation alone has no effect on the binding of the inhibitor to NF-kB [430,435,436]; however, it does provide a signal for ubiquitination at lysines 21 and 22 [437-439], which stimulates degradation of IkBaby the 26S proteasome complex. Dissociation of IkB and NF-kB proteins permits migration of the active NF-kB dimer to the nucleus [440], where it can bind to DNA and initiate transcription. ROS activate NF-kB by causing the release of the inhibitory subunit (IkB) from the NF-kB complex [11].",

To elucidate molecular mechanisms possibly linking these events, as well as to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the cyclopentenone prostaglandin A1 (PGA1), an inducer of heat shock proteins (HSPs), we exposed human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells to the complex I inhibitor rotenone. Dose-dependent apoptosis was preceded by the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and then the activation of caspase-3 over the ensuing 24 h. PGA1 increased the expression of HSP70 and HSP27 and protected against rotenone-induced apoptosis, without increasing necrotic death. PGA1 blocked the rotenone-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and attenuated, but did not abolish, the caspase-3 elevation. Unexpectedly, the caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD.CHO (DEVD), at a concentration that completely prevented the caspase-3 elevation produced by rotenone, failed to protect against apoptosis. These results suggest that complex I deficiency in dopamine cells can induce apoptosis by a process involving early NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and caspase-3 activation. PGA1 appears to protect against rotenone-induced cell death by inducing HSPs and blocking nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in a process that attenuates caspase-3 activation, but is not mediated by its inhibition.",

              "summary_text": "Endocrine therapy with an estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted antiestrogen, such as tamoxifen, or estrogen ablation by aromatase inhibitors is clinically indicated for the management of all forms of ER-positive breast cancer. However, 30-50% of ER-positive breast cancer cases fail to benefit clinically from endocrine therapy alone, and recent molecular evidence suggests that 'crosstalk' pathways originating from activated receptor tyrosine kinases and/or other proliferative and survival signals may be contributing to this endocrine resistance. Molecular identification and validation of candidate ER crosstalking pathways will likely lead to clinically important prognostic markers and targets for the application of novel therapeutics in combination with standard endocrine agents. This review focuses on a critical survival and proliferation pathway involving activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that for nearly two decades have been known to be critical regulators of mammalian immune and inflammatory responses, and more recently have been associated with chemotherapy resistance. With the demonstration that activation of NFkappaB is absolutely required for normal mammary gland development, NFkappaB involvment in human breast cancers was initially explored and linked to the development of hormone-independent (ER-negative) breast cancer. Newer clinical evidence now implicates NFkappaB activation, particularly DNA-binding by the p50 subunit of NFkappaB, as a potential prognostic marker capable of identifying a high-risk subset of ER-positive, primary breast cancers destined for early relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen. Furthermore, initial preclinical studies suggest that treatment strategies designed to prevent or interrupt activation of NFkappaB in cell-line models of these more aggressive, ER-positive breast cancers can restore their sensitivity to such standard endocrine agents as tamoxifen.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The -300 bp CCL3 promoter and -222 bp CCL4 promoter were strongly up-regulated by co-transfection with the C/EBPb expression vector. Mutation of the C/EBPb motif and reduction of C/EBPb expression by siRNA decreased the up-regulation. Additionally, another cytokine-related transcription factor, NF-kB, was also shown to be involved in the up-regulation of chemokines in response to IL-1?, and the binding site was identified. The regulation of C/EBPb and NF-kB was confirmed by the inhibition by C/EBPb and NF-kB and by transfection with C/EBPk and NF-kB expression vectors in the presence or absence of IL-1b.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

This led us to examine the effect of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory compound that targets IkB kinase and has insulin-sensitizing effects [32]. Remarkably, aspirin dramatically decreased endotoxin-induced resistin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Both aspirin (via IkB kinase) and rosiglitazone (via PPARg) inhibit NF-kB [31,32], which is activated by LPS. Indeed, treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-kB activation [33], abrogated endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of the macrophages with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF-kB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation [34], nearly abolished endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (Figure 4D). Thus, activation of NF-kB is required for LPS induction of resistin in human macrophages.",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185].

A strong driving force in sustaining the long lasting efforts to understand the function and regulation of MYC is its potent role as an oncoprotein in human tumors. The first myc gene emerged almost 30 years ago when it was realized that several highly transforming chicken retroviruses had captured a cellular sequence that transformed myeloid cells among others, hence the name myc for myelomonocytic leukemia (1, 2). In mammals several MYC genes, includingMYC(formerly c-MYC, gene and protein symbols as proposed by the Human Genome Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/ index.html)), MYCN, and MYCL, have been identified. All three have been implicated in the genesis of human malignancies and suffer in many instances from different genetic alterations, including translocations and amplifications (for a more detailed overview see supplemental Fig. S1) (3, 4). In addition the MYC promoter is targeted by multiple signal transduction cascades, including the WNT, RAS/RAF/MAPK,2 JAK/STAT, transforming growth factor beta, and NF-kappaB pathways, that are deregulated in cancer cells and contribute to enhanced MYC expression (5, 6). These tumor-associated alterations in general deregulate and enhance MYC expression.",

DNA-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed binding of p300 to several DNA-bound transactivators at basal state. Following stimulation with LPS plus IFN-gamma, binding of p300, p50/p65 NF-kappaB, and IFN-regulatory factor-1 was increased by approximately 2-fold. Nuclear p50 was complexed with and acetylated by p300 at the basal binding state which was increased by LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation. p300 overexpression resulted in increased p50 acetylation which was reduced by HAT mutation. p50 acetylation correlated with increased NF-kappaB binding and enhanced p300 recruitment. Co-overexpression of E1A abolished the augmentation of p50 acetylation and p50 binding induced by p300 overexpression, and a correlative suppression of p300 recruitment to the complex. We conclude that p300 is essential for iNOS transcription. Our results suggest that p300 HAT acetylates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, thereby increasing NF-kappaB binding and NF-kappaB mediated transactivation.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

RALA hepatocytes were transiently transfected with the AP-1-driven firefly luciferase reporter construct Coll73-Luc, and the constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK for normalization. No significant increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity occurred in Ad5LacZ-infected cells at 4 hours after TNF treatment (Fig. 1B). AP-1 transcriptional activity in Ad5IkappaB-infected cells was increased slightly in untreated cells and almost 3-fold in cells treated with TNF (Fig. 1B).

A significant lower basal level of MnSOD was detected in DN I?B mutant cells compared with vector control cells. Whereas the levels of MnSOD in vector cells were maintained in hyperoxia up to 2 d, the levels of MnSOD in DN I?B mutant cells were significantly reduced in prolonged hyperoxia (Fig. 5). These results suggest that NF-?B executes its protective role against nonapoptotic cell death in lung epithelial cells by maintaining the levels of MnSOD in hyperoxia.",

The p53 protein regulates the transcription of several celldeath genes including BH3-only proteins, proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax and the caspase-9 adaptor Apaf-1. In cells lacking p53, E2F-1 can act through p73, a member of p53 family that activates some of the same target genes as p53. E2F-1 can also directly regulate the transcription of several different caspases and suppress cell survival pathways by suppressing Mcl-1 expression or by inhibiting NFkB-mediated antiapoptotic signaling.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

The role of NF-kappaB in the cumulative changes in gene expression with transformation and progression of the murine SCC Pam 212 and after switching off NF-kappaB by a dominant negative inhibitor kappaB mutant (IkappaBalphaM) was explored by profiling with a 15,000-element cDNA micoarrray. Remarkably, NF-kappaB modulated the expression of 60% of the 308 genes differentially expressed between normal keratinocytes and metastatic SCCs. NF-kappaB directly or indirectly modulated expression of programs of genes functionally linked to proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and angiogenesis. Among these, changes in expression of cyclin D1, inhibitor of apoptosis-1, mutant Trp53, and beta-catenin detected with modulation of NF-kappaB by microarray were confirmed by Western and Northern blot. NF-kappaB DNA binding motifs were detected in the promoter of approximately 63% of genes showing increased expression and 33% of the genes showing decreased expression. The ACTACAG motif implicated in the NF-kappaB-dependent down-regulation of mRNA expression of MyoD and Sox9 was detected in the coding portion of about 15% of genes showing increased or decreased expression. Inactivation of NF-kappaB inhibited malignant phenotypic features including proliferation, cell survival, migration, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. These results provide evidence that NF-kappaB is an important modulator of gene expression programs that contribute to the malignant phenotype of SCC.",

Binding started to decrease after 60 min, with basal levels reached by 120 min. Specific NF-{kappa}B binding was competed out with excess unlabeled probe (Fig. 8B). Specific localization of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-{kappa}B complex involved in promoter binding was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Fibroblasts in eight-well chamber slides were treated with 1% CSE for 1 h and then stained for p50 and p65 (Fig. 8C). Fibroblasts treated with medium alone had a diffuse p50 and p65 staining in the cytoplasm, and only weak staining was observed in the nucleus, explaining NF-{kappa}B basal binding observed during EMSA analysis. CSE treatment led to translocation of both subunits observed as increased staining in the nucleus (shown by arrows) and decreased cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 8C).

This led us to examine the effect of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory compound that targets IkB kinase and has insulin-sensitizing effects [32]. Remarkably, aspirin dramatically decreased endotoxin-induced resistin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Both aspirin (via IkB kinase) and rosiglitazone (via PPARg) inhibit NF-kB [31,32], which is activated by LPS. Indeed, treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-kB activation [33], abrogated endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of the macrophages with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF-kB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation [34], nearly abolished endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (Figure 4D). Thus, activation of NF-kB is required for LPS induction of resistin in human macrophages.",

Metformin has been shown to activate AMPK. We hypothesized that metformin may prevent nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines. Metformin was observed to activate AMPK, as well as its downstream target, phosphoacetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Metformin also dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB kinase activity. Furthermore, metformin attenuated the TNF-alpha-induced gene expression of various proinflammatory and cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in HUVECs. A pharmacological activator of AMPK, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced NF-kappaB reporter gene expression. AICAR also suppressed the TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced gene expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in HUVECs. The small interfering RNA for AMPKalpha1 attenuated metformin or AICAR-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha, suggesting a possible role of AMPK in the regulation of cell inflammation. In light of these findings, we suggest that metformin attenuates the cytokine-induced expression of proinflammatory and adhesion molecule genes by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation via AMPK activation. Thus, it might be useful to target AMPK signaling in future efforts to prevent atherogenic and inflammatory vascular disease.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Dependence on one or more signalsome subunits was stringently evaluated by adhering to two criteria: wild type MEF absolute calls of \\\"present\\\" (P) and \\\"increase\\\" (I) average difference calls. Each screen was performed with cells stimulated for 2 h with 10 ng/ml human TNFalpha .

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMNs to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells. The oxidants augment NF-ÃŽÂºB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells and increased PMN migration.

However, the molecular mechanism of this pathway remains unclear. In this report we demonstrate that both NIK and IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) are involved in LTbetaR signaling and that the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit at serine 536 in its transactivation domain 1 (TA1) plays an essential role. We also found that NF-kappaB could be activated in the LTbetaR pathway without altering the level of the phosphorylation of IkappaB and nuclear localization of p65. By using a heterologous transactivation system in which Gal4-dependent reporter gene is activated by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in fusion with various portions of p65, we found that TA1 serves as a direct target in the NIK-IKKalpha pathway. In addition, mutation studies have revealed the essential role of Ser-536 within TA1 of p65 in transcriptional control mediated by NIK-IKKalpha. Furthermore, we found that Ser-536 was phosphorylated following the stimulation of LTbetaR, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by the kinase-dead dominant-negative mutant of either NIK or IKKalpha. These observations provide evidence for a crucial role of the NIK-IKKalpha cascade for NF-kappaB activation in LTbetaR signaling.",

NF-?B activation is known to regulate cellular growth responses, including apoptosis, and is required for the induction of inflammatory and tissue-repair genes, including macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The NF-?B pathway is also responsible for the generation of several cell adhesion molecules including ICAM-1 whose expression is signifi cantly correlated with an increase in H pylori induced gastritis[54].",

In contrast, no overt phenotype was seen upon muscle-specific inhibition of NF-kappaB through expression of IkappaBalpha superrepressor (MISR). Muscle loss was due to accelerated protein breakdown through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Expression of the E3 ligase MuRF1, a mediator of muscle atrophy, was increased in MIKK mice. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB/MuRF1 pathway reversed muscle atrophy. Denervation- and tumor-induced muscle loss were substantially reduced and survival rates improved by NF-kappaB inhibition in MISR mice, consistent with a critical role for NF-kappaB in the pathology of muscle wasting and establishing it as an important clinical target for the treatment of muscle atrophy. We show that activation of NF-kappaB, through muscle-specific transgenic expression of activated IkappaB kinase beta (MIKK)...

              "summary_text": "In order to identify genes associated with metastasis, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed using murine osteosarcoma cell line Dunn and its subline with higher metastatic potential, LM8. SSH revealed expression of the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP; also known as p97) to be constitutively activated in LM8 cells, but it declined in Dunn cells when the cells became confluent. Because VCP is known to be involved in the ubiquitination process of Inhibitor-kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), an inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), whether VCP influences NFkappaB activation or not was examined by using VCP-transfected Dunn cells (Dunn/VCPs). When stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), Dunn/VCPs showed constantly activated NFkappaB, although in the original Dunn cells and control vector transfectant (Dunn/Dunn-c) NFkappaB activation ceased when the cells became confluent. Western immunoblot analysis showed an increase of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha (p-IkappaBalpha) in the cytoplasm of confluent Dunn/Dunn-c cells compared to that of Dunn/VCPs. Therefore, decrease of p-IkappaBalpha degrading activity might be responsible for the decrease in NFkappaB activation. In vitro apoptosis assay demonstrated increased apoptosis rates of Dunn/Dunn-c cells after TNFalpha stimulation compared to those of Dunn/VCPs and LM8 cells. In vivo metastasis assay showed increased incidences of metastatic events in Dunn/VCP-1 inoculated male C3H mice compared to those in Dunn/Dunn-c inoculated mice. These findings suggested that VCP expression plays an important role in the metastatic process. Anti-apoptotic potential in these cells owing to constant NFkappaB activation via efficient cytoplasmic p-IkappaBalpha degrading activity may explain the increased metastatic potential of these cells.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "LOX-1, a receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. LOX-1 activation also plays an important role in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. A number of studies show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce total LDL cholesterol and exert a cardioprotective effect. We examined the modulation of LOX-1 expression and its function by two different statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin, in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). We observed that ox-LDL (40 microg/ml) treatment up-regulated the expression of E- and P-selectins, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in HCAECs. Ox-LDL mediated these effects via LOX-1, since antisense to LOX-1 mRNA decreased LOX-1 expression and subsequent adhesion molecule expression. Pretreatment of HCAECs with simvastatin or atorvastatin (1 and 10 microM) reduced ox-LDL-induced expression of LOX-1 as well as adhesion molecules (all P microM) was more potent than the low concentration (1 microM) (P Both statins reduced ox-LDL-mediated activation of the redox-sensitive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) but not AP-1. These observations indicate that LOX-1 activation plays an important role in ox-LDL-induced expression of adhesion molecules. Inhibition of expression of LOX-1 and adhesion molecules and activation of NF-kappaB may be another mechanism of beneficial effects of statins in vascular diseases.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The opposite effects on promoter activity were due to differences in the NF-kappaB dimer type binding to the kappaB sites. p50/p65 dimer preferentially binds to the NF-kappaB1 site and up-regulates promoter activity; while p50/p50 dimer preferentially binds to the NF-kappaB2 site and down-regulates promoter activity.",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

This protein, designated PRDI-BF1, binds specifically to the PRDI element of the beta-IFN gene promoter and is distinct from previously reported proteins that bind to this sequence. PRDI-BF1 is an 88-kD protein containing five zinc-finger motifs. Cotransfection experiments in cultured mammalian cells revealed that PRDI-BF1 is a potent repressor of PRDI-dependent transcription. PRDI-BF1 blocks virus induction of the intact beta-IFN gene promoter and of synthetic promoters containing multiple PRDI sites. PRDI-BF1 can also block the SV40 enhancer when PRDI sites are located between the enhancer and the promoter. This repression is highly dependent on the location of the PRDI sites, however, indicating that PRDI-BF1 cannot act at a distance. On the basis of the properties of PRDI-BF1 and the observation that PRDI-BF1 mRNA accumulation is virus inducible, we propose that PRDI-BF1 may act as a postinduction repressor of the beta-IFN gene by displacing positive regulatory proteins from the PRDI site of the promoter.",
