      "boundary_conditions": "The human model sets were built to represent healthy processes and were then enhanced with COPD data to represent early COPD (GOLD stage I and II) processes. If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. For a mechanism predicted from COPD data it was incorporated into a network with an edge based on COPD studies if available, and if not healthy context was used to incorporate these COPD mechanisms. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. We excluded cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, all virus infections, all bacterial infections, septic pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), allergic responses/asthma, pneumoconiosis, and COPD exacerbations. We also excluded animal inhalation studies with solid particles (titanium dioxide, quartz, asbestos, carbon black, diesel exhaust etc). For the in vitro-specific exclusion criteria we excluded tumor-derived cell lines, immortalized cell lines, neuronal cells, and cell types that cannot be found in the respiratory/vascular system. There were some exceptions where we included immortalized cell lines and non-lung cell types for canonical mechanisms where there was evidence that the relationship was not tissue-specific but could also take place in the lung. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

              "summary_text": "The TR3 expression vector was trans-fected into HEK293T cells, which were then treated with anisomycin, a potent inducer of JNK (18). Immunoblotting analysis revealed that anisomycin treatment resulted in the slow migration of the expressed GFP-TR3 protein, compared to the GFP-TR3 protein expressed in untreated cells (Fig. 11B). The anisomycin-induced retarded migration of the TR3 protein was prevented when cells were pretreated with a JNK inhibitor. These results suggest that phosphorylation of TR3 by JNK was responsible for the slower migration of the TR3 protein. Similar to full-length TR3, the N-terminal mutant of TR3 (TR3-1-151), which contained the first 151 amino acid residues, was modified by the anisomycin treatment, which was also prevented by the JNK inhibitor (Fig. 11B). In contrast, the migration of TR3/122, which lacks the first 122 amino acid residues, was not affected by anisomycin treatment. These data strongly suggest that TR3 is mainly phosphorylated on the N terminus by JNK. To determine whether phosphorylation of TR3 by JNK affected its DNA binding, a gel retardation assay was conducted to determine the binding of TR3 protein to NurRE before and after its phosphorylation by JNK. As shown in Fig. 11C, bacterially expressed TR3 protein formed a strong complex with the NurRE. However, upon phosphorylation by JNK in vitro, binding of TR3 to the NurRE was largely impaired. In addition, the weak complex formed between TR3 and NurRE migrated slightly faster than that formed by unphosphorylated TR3, probably reflecting a change in TR3 conformation by phosphorylation.",

After 48 hours, total cell lysates were prepared and subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdk4 antibodies following 2 hours of HRG stimulation. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with wild type BRCA1 or with c-terminal truncated BRCA1.

Although cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were more abundant in the cytoplasmic fraction after partial hepatectomy, kinase activity was detected primarily in the nuclear fraction. Cytoplasmic cyclin D1/Cdk4 complexes were activated by recombinant cyclin H/Cdk7. Because endogenous Cdk7 activity was found in the nucleus, this suggests that activation of cyclin D1/Cdk4 requires nuclear importation and subsequent phosphorylation by cyclin H/Cdk7.",

              "summary_text": "The TR3 expression vector was trans-fected into HEK293T cells, which were then treated with anisomycin, a potent inducer of JNK (18). Immunoblotting analysis revealed that anisomycin treatment resulted in the slow migration of the expressed GFP-TR3 protein, compared to the GFP-TR3 protein expressed in untreated cells (Fig. 11B). The anisomycin-induced retarded migration of the TR3 protein was prevented when cells were pretreated with a JNK inhibitor. These results suggest that phosphorylation of TR3 by JNK was responsible for the slower migration of the TR3 protein. Similar to full-length TR3, the N-terminal mutant of TR3 (TR3-1-151), which contained the first 151 amino acid residues, was modified by the anisomycin treatment, which was also prevented by the JNK inhibitor (Fig. 11B). In contrast, the migration of TR3/122, which lacks the first 122 amino acid residues, was not affected by anisomycin treatment. These data strongly suggest that TR3 is mainly phosphorylated on the N terminus by JNK. To determine whether phosphorylation of TR3 by JNK affected its DNA binding, a gel retardation assay was conducted to determine the binding of TR3 protein to NurRE before and after its phosphorylation by JNK. As shown in Fig. 11C, bacterially expressed TR3 protein formed a strong complex with the NurRE. However, upon phosphorylation by JNK in vitro, binding of TR3 to the NurRE was largely impaired. In addition, the weak complex formed between TR3 and NurRE migrated slightly faster than that formed by unphosphorylated TR3, probably reflecting a change in TR3 conformation by phosphorylation.",

Cytoplasmic retention of p27kip1 may occur through increased export or reduced import. Interaction of p27kip1 with JAB1/CNS5 or phosphorylation of serine 10 (S10) by the hKIS kinase promotes p27kip1 export from the nucleus, whereas phosphorylation of threonine 157 (T157) by the protein kinase B/AKT (AKT) impairs its import.",

Mutations within the 3(10) helix region of the p57 molecule completely abolished the ability to arrest the cell cycle at G1 in vivo. These results indicate that this region is specifically utilized by p57 in selectively inhibiting cyclin A or E/Cdk2+ activities. Thus the 3(10) helix motif may confer a specific regulatory mechanism by which p57 differentially regulates Cdk2 and Cdk4 activities.",

In this report, we show that overexpression of BRG1 causes growth arrest and induction of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, which can be overcome by cyclin E. Our results suggest that cyclin E may modulate the activity of the SWI-SNF apparatus to maintain the chromatin in a transcriptionally permissive state.",

Using pharmaceutical inhibitors and dominant active MAP kinase kinases, we demonstrated that activation of the p38 pathway, but not the ERK or JNK pathways, is necessary and sufficient to transactivate PPARgamma, a nuclear receptor that has recently been shown to play a pivotal role in oxLDL-induced CD36 expression.

The crucial roles of PPAR? and C/EBP? were highlighted by the observation that overexpression of either transcription factor in NIH3T3 cells is sufficient to convert these normally nonadipogenic cells from fibroblasts into adipocytes [29,30]. However, it was unclear whether either transcription factor, completely on its own, could induce adipogenesis. CEBPA-null MEF cells failed to undergo adipogenesis, but this defect could be successfully restored by overexpression of PPAR?2 [28]. Rosen et al. [31] performed the reverse strategy; forced C/EBP? expression in PPARG-null MEFs, and found that the cells remained defective for adipogenesis. These studies convincingly demonstrated that PPAR?2 is the ultimate key regulator of adipogenesis and C/EBP? might play more of an accessory role for PPAR?2 by inducing and maintaining PPAR?2 expression. The primary function of C/EBP? could be the regulation of genes involved in the metabolic actions of insulin, such as glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) [28]. Clearly, PPAR? and C/EBP? are key transcription factors in adipogenesis, acting synergistically to generate fully differentiated, insulin-responsive adipocytes [28,32]. PPAR? and the physiology of the mature adipocyte In addition to the key role that PPAR? plays in adipogenesis, it also appears to carry out important metabolic functions in intact organisms. In patients with T2DM, activation of PPAR? by synthetic ligands, such as the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), results in a dramatic improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity and a reduction in plasma glucose concentrations [33].",

              "summary_text": "The molecular mechanism by which hypolipidemic fibrates and antidiabetic thiazolidinediones exert their hypotriglyceridemic action are discussed. Increased activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a key lipolytic enzyme, and decreased levels of apolipoprotein C-III (apo C-III) seem to explain the hypotriglyceridemic effects of compounds. Both fibrates and thiazolidinediones exert their action by activating transcription factors of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) family, thereby modulating the expression of the LPL and apo C-II genes. First, treatment of rats with PPAR alpha activators, such as fibrates induced LPL mRNA and activity selectively in the liver. In contrast, the thiazolidinediones, which are high affinity ligands for PPAR gamma, have no effect on liver, but induce LPL mRNA and activity levels in adipose tissue. In hepatocytes, fibrates, unlike the thiazolidinediones, induce LPL mRNA levels, whereas in preadipocyte cell lines the PPAR gamma ligand induces LPL mRNA levels much quicker and to a higher extent than fibrates. Second, apo C-III mRNA and protein production strongly decrease in livers of fibrate but not thiazolidinedione-treated animals. Fibrates also reduced apo C-III production in primary cultures of rat and human hepatocytes. The modulation of the expression of the LPL and apo C-III genes by either PPAR alpha or gamma activators, correlates with the tissue-specific distribution of the respective PPARs: PPAR gamma expression is restricted to adipose tissues, whereas PPAR alpha is expressed predominantly in liver. In both the LPL and apo C-III genes, sequence elements responsible for the modulation of their expression by activated PPARs have been identified which supports that the transcriptional regulation of these genes by fibrates and thiazolidinediones contributes significantly to their hypotriglyceridemic effects in vivo. Whereas thiazolidinediones predominantly affect adipocyte LPL production through activation of PPAR gamma, fibrates exert their effects mainly in the liver via a PPAR alpha-mediated reduction in apo C-III production. This tissue specific transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism by PPAR activators and/or ligands might have important therapeutic implications.",

Upon the addition of adipogenic cocktail to 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, there is a rapid and transient elevation in C/EBPb and C/EBPd [7,9] The appearance of these proteins is followed rapidly by the expression of C/EBPa, and by the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg). These two factors remain elevated for the rest of the differentiation process and indeed for the life of the mature adipocyte. C/EBPa and PPARg are the most critical factors yet discovered for adipogenesis, as will be discussed below. For the moment, suffice it to say that virtually every single downstream target gene whose expression defines the adipocyte appears to be regulated by one or both of these proteins. All of the aforementioned factors, C/EBPa, C/EBPb, C/EBPd, and PPARg, can induce or accelerate differentiation in non-adipogenic NIH-3T3 cells [7].",

This led us to examine the effect of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory compound that targets IkB kinase and has insulin-sensitizing effects [32]. Remarkably, aspirin dramatically decreased endotoxin-induced resistin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Both aspirin (via IkB kinase) and rosiglitazone (via PPARg) inhibit NF-kB [31,32], which is activated by LPS. Indeed, treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-kB activation [33], abrogated endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of the macrophages with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF-kB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation [34], nearly abolished endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (Figure 4D). Thus, activation of NF-kB is required for LPS induction of resistin in human macrophages.",

Because DR-1 elements are preferred binding sites for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), we tested the hypothesis that PPARs regulate ALDH2 expression. METHODS: We examined the ability of PPAR isoforms to bind to the ALDH2 NRRE in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, their ability to activate the transcription of promoter-reporter constructs containing this NRRE, the effect of PPAR ligands on ALDH2 expression in liver, and the role of the PPARalpha on the expression of ALDH2 by using PPARalpha-null mice. RESULTS: In vitro translated PPARs bound the ALDH NRRE with high affinity. Mutation of the NRRE indicated that binding was mediated by the DR-1 element. Cotransfection of PPAR expression plasmids showed that PPARalpha had no effect on expression of heterologous promoter constructs containing the NRRE. PPARgamma slightly induced expression, whereas PPARdelta repressed basal activity of the promoter and blocked induction by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4. Treatment of rats with the PPAR ligand clofibrate repressed expression of ALDH2 in rats fed either stock rodent chow or a low-protein diet. Consistent with the transfection data, expression of ALDH2 protein was not different in PPARalpha-null mice. Treatment of the mice with the PPARalpha agonist WY14643 slightly decreased the level of ALDH2 protein in both wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice, suggesting that the effect of WY14643 was not mediated by the receptor. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that ALDH2 is not part of the battery of lipid metabolizing enzymes and proteins regulated by PPARalpha",

              "summary_text": "This in vitro model of differentiation appears to be quite faithful to the in vivo process, inasmuch as the cultured cells accumulate lipid, express virtually all markers of mature adipocytes, and become insulin sensitive. Their ready availability, lack of heterogeneity (as contrasted to the native fat pad, which contains a large number of non-adipocytes), and synchronous development all contribute to their utility. Nonetheless, these cells are only a model, and lessons learned from their use must be tested in vivo or in other cellular systems (e.g. mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Additionally, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes are already committed to the adipocytic lineage. This means that they can provide no real insight into the process of determination, which must be studied in vivo or in multipotent cells such as NIH-3T3 fibroblasts or C3H10T1/2 cells. The differentiation of all specific cell types depends upon the coordinated regulation of cascades of transcription factors. Each of these proteins is responsible for inducing downstream transcription factors or genes that typify the differentiated phenotype. In fact, most of the transcriptional regulators of adipogenesis (or of other differentiation programs such as myogenesis) seem to operate in a \\\"feed-forward\\\" fashion, whereby they induce both other pro-adipogenic factors and then cooperate with those factors to promote downstream gene expression. An example would be PPARg (discussed in greater detail below), which induces the expression of the adipogenic transcription factor C/EBPa and then binds with C/EBPa to the promoter/ enhancer of the gene encoding the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein aP2 (FABP4) [5,6].",

              "summary_text": "This finding is consistent with a previous report39 in which TZD treatment increased PDK-4 and UCP-3 mRNA in adipose tissue, but led to a decrease in mRNA in skeletal muscle; whether this effect was primary or secondary could not be determined. In the current study, we found that mRNA levels were equally decreased by TZDs in control and MKO mice. Because the MKO mice lack PPAR-gamma in muscle, this suggests that the TZDs act indirectly in whole animals to decrease skeletal muscle PDK-4 and UCP-3 mRNA.  Discussion The well-known role of PPAR-gamma in adipocyte function and differentiation and as the molecular target of antidiabetic TZDs suggests a specific role for adipose tissue in the etiology of the disease6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 39, 40. This view is strengthened by the observations that PPAR-gamma is expressed at much higher levels in fat than in muscle, and that obesity is a primary risk factor for diabetes13, 23, 33, 40, 41. Despite these observations, muscle is the primary organ for insulin-stimulated glucose disposal5, 42, leading to the theory that in vivo insulin resistance cannot occur without a defect in muscle42, 43, 44. Using tissue- specific disruption of PPAR-gamma expression, we showed that targeted loss of PPAR-gamma in muscle results in a state of severe insulin resistance. The postprandial hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in targeted Pparg knockout mice from all ages provides the first direct evidence that PPAR-gamma directly coordinates glucoregulatory responses in skeletal muscle.  The identification of muscle as a crucial tissue for PPAR-gamma signaling raises the question of how this effect is achieved. Presumably this occurs, at least in part, through the regulation of specific target genes, although this muscle genetic network has not yet been identified. In addition, it seems that defects in muscle can lead to secondary adverse effects in liver and adipose tissue insulin action. Insulin resistance in hepatic and adipose tissue may be secondary to the hyperinsulinemia those animals exhibit, or it could reflect the paracrine influence of an unknown PPAR-gamma-regulated secreted factor from muscle. Indeed, as a result of primary insulin resistance in muscle, PPAR-gamma-deficient animals also developed hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and hypertriglyceridemia. Taken together, all of these events recapitulate most of the manifestations of human Syndrome X, showing that a molecular defect causing insulin resistance in muscle can, over time, mimic most of the features of the human disease43.  To evaluate potential cellular mechanisms of insulin resistance in MKO muscle, we measured the mRNA and/or protein expression levels of GLUT-4 and certain insulin signaling molecules. We found no differences in insulin receptor, IRS-1, Akt or GLUT-4 mRNA expression levels, or in IRS-1, Akt or GLUT-4 protein levels, in muscle samples from MKO and control animals. In contrast, significant defects in insulin signaling were observed when protein phosphorylation was measured. Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 at position 307 inhibits insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, blunting downstream insulin-mediated signaling37. Using a phospho-specific antibody, we found increased IRS-1 serine phosphorylation in the MKO samples, with a corresponding decrease in insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and Akt activation. The decreases in these aspects of insulin signaling are consistent with the observed in vivo insulin resistance in the MKO animals, but we cannot yet determine whether these signaling defects are primary or secondary to the hyperinsulinemia, the elevated FFA levels or some other aspect of the insulin-resistant state.  We also treated the PPAR-gamma-deficient animals with insulin- sensitizing TZDs. The results clearly show that TZD treatment did not augment insulin-stimulated GDR. Because the majority of GDR is account...",

Activation of PPARgamma will selectively induce the expression of several genes involved in fatty acid uptake, such as lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid transport protein and acyl-CoA synthetase, in adipose tissue without changing their expression in muscle tissue. This co-ordinate regulation of fatty acid partitioning by PPARgamma results in an adipocyte 'FFA steal' causing a relative depletion of fatty acids in the muscle.",

To better understand the early molecular signals responsible for the effects of Dex and RA, Affymetrix gene profiling was done on RNA isolated from 4-day-old mice after treatment with 1) diluent, 2) RA (1 mg/kg), 3) Dex (0.7 microg/pup), or 4) RA + Dex. Each sample was assayed in duplicate on U74Av2 GeneChips. Data were analyzed with Affymetrix suite 5.0, corrected for saturation, and evaluated with GeneSpring 5.1 software. Stringent filtering of data by the global error model and condition-to-condition comparisons was used to identify 46 genes demonstrating significantly different expression between the lungs of Dex- and RA + Dex-treated mice. A query of the gene ontology database revealed that the major biological processes affected by treatment with Dex and RA were cell growth/maintenance and cellular communication. On the basis of microarray data analysis, we hypothesize that Dex-induced inhibition of septation is associated with a block in angiogenesis due to downregulation of the kinase domain receptor (KDR), also known as VEGF receptor-2 and fetal liver kinase, and that the downregulation of KDR is prevented by treatment with RA.",

These data suggest either that in the obese rat the b3-AR gene is abnormally regulated in response to changes in sympathetic activity or that an adrenal factor, most probably corticosterone, is responsible for the low levels of P3-AR mRNA. Such a corticosterone effect may be mediated indirectly through insulin, which has been shown to downregulate the expression of b3-AR mRNA in 3T3- F442A cells (14).

A fusion protein consisting of the amino terminal fragment of urokinase and of human serum albumin inhibits endothelial cell in vitro migration induced by bFGF and by VEGF [161], whereas a fusion protein consisting of the mouse uPA GFD and of the Fc-fragment of IgG inhibits bFGF and VEGF-stimulated branching morphogenesis in an endothelial cell tube formation assay on a fibrin matrix [162].  Retinoids stimulate endothelial cell tube formation also on fibrin matrices and addition of uPA to this system enhances this stimulation, whereas an antibody that blocked urokinase binding to the receptor inhibits the effects of uPA. In the same system, steroid hormones (testosterone, dexamethasone) inhibit tube formation and addition of uPA to the system prevents the effect of steroids [163].",

              "summary_text": "BACKGROUND: The receptor of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) contains the signal transduction protein gp130, which is also a component of the receptors of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-11, and oncostatin M. This suggests that these cytokines might share common signaling pathways. We previously reported that CNTF augments the levels of corticosterone (CS) and of IL-6 induced by IL-1 and induces the production of the acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA). Since the elevation of serum CS is an important feedback mechanism to limit the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF), we have investigated the effect of CNTF on both TNF production and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To induce serum TNF levels, LPS was administered to mice at 30 mg/kg i.p. and CNTF was administered as a single dose of 10 micrograms/mouse i.v., either alone or in combination with its soluble receptor sCNTFR alpha at 20 micrograms/mouse. Serum TNF levels were the measured by cytotoxicity on L929 cells. In order to measure the effects of CNTF on LPS-induced TNF production in the brain, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with 2.5 micrograms/kg LPS. Mouse spleen cells cultured for 4 hr with 1 microgram LPS/ml, with or without 10 micrograms CNTF/ml, were also analyzed for TNF production. RESULTS: CNTF, administered either alone or in combination with its soluble receptor, inhibited the induction of serum TNF levels by LPS. This inhibition was also observed in the brain when CNTF and LPS were administered centrally. In vitro, CNTF only marginally affected TNF production by LPS-stimulated mouse splenocytes, but it acted synergistically with dexamethasone (DEX) in inhibiting TNF production. Most importantly, CNTF administered together with sCNTFR alpha protected mice against LPS-induced mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CNTF might act as a protective cytokine against TNF-mediated pathologies both in the brain and in the periphery.",

We provide evidence that chronic activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in clonal neurons inhibits the transcriptional activity of the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which is believed to be involved in memory processes. To investigate the underlying mechanism we studied the phosphorylation of CREB and found altered phosphorylation kinetics in neurons chronically treated with glucocorticoids. Our results demonstrate a hitherto unrecognized crosstalk between the cyclic AMP and glucocorticoid pathway and may provide the molecular basis for the effects of long-term glucocorticoid exposure on cognitive function.",

              "summary_text": "Regarding the third mechanism, the expression of GLUT4 is subjected to tissue-specific, hormonal and metabolic regulation (Charron et al. 1999). Studies in vivo clearly indicate that GLUT4 gene expression is down-regulated in states of relative insulin deficiency such as streptozotocin-induced diabetes and chronic fasting, a situation that is reversed by insulin treatment and refeeding (Sivitz et al. 1989). In primary cultures of brown adipocytes, insulin/IGF-I transactivated the full promoter GLUT4-CAT fusion gene and up-regulated the expression of the GLUT4 gene, producing a time-dependent mRNA accumulation and significantly increased the amount of protein located in total membrane fraction. Consequently, glucose uptake was augmented (Valverde et al. 1999b). Inhibition of PI3K with either wortmannin or LY294002 or transient transfection with constructs encoding dominant negative p85 down-regulated insulin-induced GLUT4 mRNA accumulation or GLUT4 protein content, as well as precluded the transactivation of the GLUT4 promoter (Valverde et al. 1999b). However, studies in white adipocytes and in skeletal muscle cells failed to establish a stimulatory role of insulin on GLUT4 expression (Flores-Riveros et al. 1993), suggesting that additional factors could be involved in this tissues. In this regard dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has been shown to increase GLUT4 expression in myocytes (Tortorella & Pilch 2002), as well as to interact with insulin on GLUT4 expression in white adipocytes (Hajduch et al. 1995).",

Thus, in the noncatalytic N-terminal region of the tPA molecule there are two additional domains as compared to the uPA molecule: a finger-domain and the second kringle-domain, which are responsible for specific binding to fibrin [24].  Precise timing and location of adequate extracellular proteolysis is provided by multiple mechanisms among which the mechanisms regulating the expression of plasminogen activators and of their inhibitors are especially important. A wide spectrum of hormones, growth factors, and cell environment factors are involved in the regulation of expression of the genes of plasminogen activators and of their inhibitors. The expression of uPA is activated by various inflammatory factors: cytokines [25], growth factors [26], and tumor promotors, such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate [27], whereas antiinflammatory agents, such as glucocorticoids, inhibit the expression of uPA [28].",

An antibody for C/EBP alpha super-shifted the nucleoprotein complex in THP-1 cells but not in the VD3-treated HL-60 cells, whereas an antibody for C/EBP beta blocked the formation of the complex with the nuclear factor of the HL-60 cells but not with that of THP-1 cells.

MEKK1 (MEK kinase-1) and MEKK3 have been implicated in the activation of IKK and MAPKK, leading to the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK (27). To examine whether MEKK1 or MEKK3 is involved in the RIG-I/IPS-1 pathway, we performed an IFN-beta and NF-kappaB reporter assay using kinase-inactive mutants of MEKK1 (knMEKK1) and MEKK3 (knMEKK3). As shown in Fig. 4A, IPS-1- and RIG-IN-induced IFN-beta promoter and NF-kappaB activities were inhibited efficiently by knMEKK1 and to a lesser extent by knMEKK3. Next we examined the effect of overexpression of MEKK1 and MEKK3. The forced expression of IRF3, MEKK1, or MEKK3 alone was not sufficient for the activation of the IFN-beta promoter; however, cotransfection of IRF3 and MEKK1, but not MEKK3 synergistically activated the promoter activity (Fig. 4B). In order to confirm the significance of endogenous MEKK1 and MEKK3, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. Wild-type MEFs were transfected with scrambled control, MEKK1, or MEKK3 siRNA construct, and then endogenous gene expression of MEKK1 as well as MEKK3 was sufficiently suppressed (Fig. 4C). The knockdown of MEKK1, but not MEKK3, resulted in a severe reduction of IFN-beta mRNA expression induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 4C). Induction of mRNA for IP-10 was slightly suppressed in the MEKK1 knockdown MEFs. Significant reduction of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta levels by knockdown of MEKK1 with different siRNA oligonucleotides was also confirmed by real time PCR (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the suppression of type I IFNs by siRNA for MEKK1 was reverted by forced expression of rat MEKK1 (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that endogenous MEKK1 but not MEKK3 is required for type I IFN production induced by cytoplasmic dsRNA.",

This was accompanied by a decrease in Cyclin D1, an increase in P27 expression, and an increased expression of TFF1. Finally, we showed that inhibition of the Ras/MAPK pathway leads to increased C/EBP alpha and TFF1 expression, and decreased cell proliferation and cyclin D1 expression in GC cells. Our results suggest that C/EBP alpha (together with other members of the C/EBP family) has an active role in the control of differentiation and proliferation in normal gastric mucosa. In GC, loss of C/EBP alpha may be associated with the switch from a cellular differentiation to a cellular proliferation program, presumably as a consequence of Ras/MAPK pathway activation.",

Loss-of-function mutation of PU.1 leads to an absolute block in monocyte/macrophage development and abnormal granulocytic development while that of C/EBPalpha causes a selective block in neutrophilic differentiation. In order to understand these phenotypes, we studied the role of PU.1 and C/EBPalpha in the regulation of myeloid target genes in vivo . Northern blot analysis revealed that mRNAs encoding receptors for M-CSF, G-CSF and GM-CSF, were expressed at low levels in PU.1(-/-) fetal liver compared with wild type. To identify additional myeloid genes regulated by PU.1 and C/EBPalpha, we performed representational difference analysis (RDA), a PCR-based subtractive hybridization using fetal livers from wild type and PU.1 or C/EBPalpha knockout mice. By introducing a new modification of RDA, that of tissue-specific gene suppression, we could selectively identify a set of differentially expressed genes specific to myeloid cells. Differentially expressed genes included both primary and secondary granule protein genes. In addition, eight novel genes were identified that were upregulated in expression during myeloid differentiation. These methods provide a general strategy for elucidating the genes affected in murine knockout models.",

              "summary_text": "This result is rather surprising given that these two proteins are identical except for their N-termini, appear to bind to the same DNAregulatory elements [PPAR-response elements (PPREs)], and are expressed in similar amounts in adipocytes. Because the N-terminus of PPAR?2 contains a ligand-independent transactivation function that is much stronger than PPAR?1 [22], the two isoforms could differentially interact with the coactivators and corepressors that mediate PPAR? transcriptional activity. Whether this function is crucial for the adipogenic role of PPAR?2 requires further study. What is the biological role of PPAR?1 in adipogenesis? One possibility is that PPAR?1, which is already expressed in preadipocytes, behaves as a priming factor (along with C/EBP? and -?) for the induction of PPAR?2, although no functional PPREs have been identified within the PPAR?2 promoter region. Another possibility is that PPAR?1 plays a role in the cell-cycle regulation, perhaps by modulating E2F or its dimerization partners (the DP proteins) [8,23]. Alternatively, PPAR?1 could be involved in the production of endogenous PPAR? ligands, which play a role in later stages of adipogenesis. Selectively blocking PPAR?1 expression without affecting the PPAR?2 would be a useful way to determine the functional role of PPAR?1 in both adipose and nonadipose tissue. During the later stage of differentiation, C/EBP? expression rises immediately after PPAR?2 expression. The requirement for PPAR? and C/EBP? in adipose development has been demonstrated by a targeted gene-knockout strategy in mice. Homozygous knockout of either gene results in embryonic lethality and failure to develop normal adipose tissue [24-27]. There has been an intense research effort to understand the relationship between these two transcription factors and the role they play in adipogenesis. Several studies have demonstrated that PPAR?2 and C/EBP? coregulate each other's expression. Mice with reduced PPAR? expression owing to heterozygous gene-knockout displayed a drastically reduced level of C/EBP?, even though no functional PPREs have been identified in the enhancer region of C/EBP? [25]. Likewise, mice with disrupted C/EBP? expression showed a reduced level of PPAR? [28]. This is probably because of direct binding of C/EBP? to the promoter region of PPAR?2 and activation of PPAR? gene transcription.",

Their ready availability, lack of heterogeneity (as contrasted to the native fat pad, which contains a large number of non-adipocytes), and synchronous development all contribute to their utility. Nonetheless, these cells are only a model, and lessons learned from their use must be tested in vivo or in other cellular systems (e.g. mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Additionally, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes are already committed to the adipocytic lineage. This means that they can provide no real insight into the process of determination, which must be studied in vivo or in multipotent cells such as NIH-3T3 fibroblasts or C3H10T1/2 cells. The differentiation of all specific cell types depends upon the coordinated regulation of cascades of transcription factors. Each of these proteins is responsible for inducing downstream transcription factors or genes that typify the differentiated phenotype. In fact, most of the transcriptional regulators of adipogenesis (or of other differentiation programs such as myogenesis) seem to operate in a \\\"feed-forward\\\" fashion, whereby they induce both other pro-adipogenic factors and then cooperate with those factors to promote downstream gene expression. An example would be PPARg (discussed in greater detail below), which induces the expression of the adipogenic transcription factor C/EBPa and then binds with C/EBPa to the promoter/ enhancer of the gene encoding the adipocyte fatty acid binding protein aP2 (FABP4) [5,6].",

Studies on the temporal induction of E2F family members demonstrated that the activating E2Fs, and most notably E2F1, were upregulated before E2F6 during cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase, and this coincided with the time course of induction experienced by the E2F6 promoter during the course of the cell cycle. EMSAs indicated the specific binding of nuclear complexes to the E2F6 promoter that contained E2F1-related species whose binding was specifically competed by the consensus E2F binding site.

Thus, we conclude that E2F1 plays an important role in the G1/S transition phase and acts on the mesangial cell cycle through two distinct pathways: (1) E2F1 directly transcribes an S-phase gene, and (2) E2F1 promotes cell cycle progression via the induction of cyclin D1 and cyclin E.",

The p53 protein regulates the transcription of several celldeath genes including BH3-only proteins, proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax and the caspase-9 adaptor Apaf-1. In cells lacking p53, E2F-1 can act through p73, a member of p53 family that activates some of the same target genes as p53.

RB and the related family members p107 and p130 can each bind E2F to repress genes that are otherwise important for progression from G1 to S phase. The binding of RB, p107, or p130 has two simultaneous consequences: (1) binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and (2) binding recruits chromatin-modifying enzymes [e.g., histone deacetylases (HDACs)] to silence transcription. E2F itself is a family of transcription factors that include six E2F and three DP proteins, which together form the heterodimeric complex that comprises E2F transcriptional activity (reviewed in Trimarchi and Lees, 2002 and Yee and Wang, 2003). While there is considerable complexity, gene repression in G1 phase utilizes RB and E2Fs 1, 2, 3, and 4, while gene repression in G0 utilizes primarily p130 and E2Fs 4 and 5. binding prevents E2F from interacting with transcriptional co-activators (e.g., p300); and",

TopBP1 is also known as a DNA damage response protein. In this study, we showed that the transcription of human MCM10 and TopBP1 is activated by transcription factors E2F1-3, but not by factors E2F4-7. Analysis of various MCM10 and TopBP1 promoter constructs showed that an E2F-responsive sequence in the vicinity of the transcription initiation site is necessary for the E2F1-induced activation of MCM10 and TopBP1 gene transcription, which is further suppressed by pRb. The promoter activities of human MCM10 and TopBP1 were demonstrated to be growth dependent via the E2F-responsive sequence. Although E2F1 was stabilized by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the mRNA expression level of TopBP1 was suppressed in HCT116 human diploid colon cancer cells. We showed, by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation that, in response to UV irradiation but not doxorubicin treatment, E2F4 accumulated on the MCM10 and TopBP1 promoters. Our data suggest a model in which UV irradiation-induced DNA damage depends, at least in part, on the accumulation of the E2F4 transcription factor on the MCM10 and TopBP1 promoters, which results in suppression of DNA replication.",

The proangiogenic phenotype in E2F1 deficiency is the result of overproduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is prevented by VEGF blockade. Under hypoxic conditions, E2F1 down-regulates the expression of VEGF promoter activity by associating with p53 and specifically down-regulating expression of VEGF but not other hypoxia-inducible genes, suggesting a promoter structure context-dependent regulation mechanism. We found that the minimum VEGF promoter mediating transcriptional repression by E2F1 features an E2F1- binding site with four Sp-1 sites in close proximity. These data disclose an unexpected function of endogenous E2F1: regulation of angiogenic activity via p53-dependent transcriptional control of VEGF expression.",

We present evidence here that ICBP90 binds to methyl-CpG when at least one symmetrically methylated-CpG dinucleotides is presented as its recognition sequence. A SET and RING finger-associated (SRA) domain accounts for the high binding affinity of ICBP90 for methyl-CpG dinucleotides. This protein constitutes a complex with HDAC1 also via its SRA domain, and bound to methylated promoter regions of various tumor suppressor genes, including p16INK4Aand p14ARF, in cancer cells. It has been reported that expression of ICBP90 was upregulated by E2F-1, and we confirmed that the upregulation was caused by binding of E2F-1 to the intron1 of ICBP90, which contains two E2F-1-binding motifs. Our data also revealed accumulation of ICBP90 in breast-cancer cells, where it might suppress expression of tumor suppressor genes through deacetylation of histones after recruitment of HDAC1. The data reported here suggest that ICBP90 is involved in cell proliferation by way of methylation-mediated regulation of certain genes.",

Phosphorylation by JNK increases the ability of c-Jun to activate AP-1-dependent transcription. To determine whether the sustained JNK activation that occurred in response to TNF and NF-kappaB inhibition resulted in increased c-Jun activation, AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity was measured in untreated and TNF treated cells. RALA hepatocytes were transiently transfected with the AP-1-driven firefly luciferase reporter construct Coll73-Luc, and the constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK for normalization. No significant increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity occurred in Ad5LacZ-infected cells at 4 hours after TNF treatment (Fig. 1B). AP-1 transcriptional activity in Ad5IkappaB-infected cells was increased slightly in untreated cells and almost 3-fold in cells treated with TNF (Fig. 1B). JNK overactivation resulting from NF-kappaB inactivation therefore led to increased AP-1-dependent transcription.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449].

Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups.

              "summary_text": "In IRAK1-deficient mice, cytokine production in response to IL-1 and LPS was diminished but not abolished25-27, whereas IRAK4-deficient mice showed virtually no response to IL-1, LPS or other bacterial components, demonstrating that IRAK4 has an important role in IL-1R/TLR signalling28. Recently, patients with an inherited IRAK4 deficiency have been identified29. These patients failed to respond to IL-1, to IL-18 or to stimulation of each of five TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9). Together, these results show that IRAK4 and its kinase activity are required for TLR signalling and that IRAK4 functions upstream of IRAK1.  TRAF6. TRAFs constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved adaptor proteins30. So far, six members of the TRAF family have been identified in mammals, and they are characterized by the presence of an N-terminal coiled-coil domain (known as TRAF-N) and a conserved C-terminal domain (known as TRAF-C). The N-terminal portion of most TRAF proteins contains a RING (really interesting new gene)-finger/zinc-finger region, which is essential for downstream signalling events, whereas the TRAF-C domain mediates self-association and interactions with upstream receptors and signalling proteins. TRAF6 functions as a signalling mediator for both the TNF-receptor superfamily and the TLR/IL-1R superfamily, interacting directly with members of the TNF-receptor superfamily (CD40 and TNF-related activation-induced cytokine receptor, TRANCER) or being coupled indirectly to TLR/IL-1R superfamily members through its association with IRAKs. The consensus sequence for the TRAF6-binding domain has been identified as P-X-E-X-X-(D/E/F/W/Y)31. This motif is found in CD40, TRANCER, and the IRAKs; three of these TRAF6-binding motifs are found in IRAK1, two in IRAK2 and one in IRAK-M.  TAK1 and TABs. The activation by TRAF6 of the transcription factors NF-kB and activator protein 1 (AP1) involves TAK1 and two adaptor proteins TAB1 and TAB2. TAK1 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family32, which has been shown to be essential for both IL-1/LPS- and TNF-induced NF-kB activation33. Two TAK1-binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2, have been identified34, 35. When co-expressed ectopically, TAB1 enhances the kinase activity of TAK1, indicating that TAB1 functions as an activator of TAK134. By contrast, TAB2 functions as an adaptor, linking TAK1 to TRAF6 and thereby facilitating TAK1 activation35. However, embryonic fibroblasts obtained from TAB2-deficient mice show no impairment in either IL-1/LPS- or TNF-induced activation of NF-kB36. Furthermore, a new TAB2-like molecule, TAB3, has been identified recently, and similar to TAB2, it has been shown to associate with TAK1 and activate NF-kB37. Co-transfection of SMALL INTERFERING RNAS (siRNAs) directed against both TAB2 and TAB3 inhibited both IL-1- and TNF-induced activation of TAK1 and NF-kB, indicating that TAB2 and TAB3 function redundantly as mediators of TAK1 activation.  It has been shown that UBIQUITYLATION has an important role in TAK1 activation and that TRAF6 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase38. TRAF6 can interact through its RING-finger domain with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (UBC13), and this UBC13-TRAF6 complex triggers TAK1 activation through the assembly of a lysine63-linked polyubiquitin chain39.  NF-kB. The NF-kB family of transcription factors is composed of five members - p65 (REL-A), REL-B, cytoplasmic (c) REL, p50 and p52 - which function as homo- and heterodimers. NF-kB dimers are usually sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by molecules of the inhibitor of NF-kB (IB) family. Activation of NF-kB involves the phosphorylation and proteolysis of the IB proteins and the concomitant release and nuclear translocation of the NF-kB factors. This acute activation process is mediated by the IB kinase (IKK) complex, which comprises two catalytic subunits - IKK- and IKK- (also kn...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Similarly, p38 MAPK activity is also linked with differentiation and recently, with senescence and tumor suppression (reviewed in Kyriakis and Avruch, 2001 and see below). The involvement of HBP1 in senescence is not known and under investigation. Conceivably, p38 MAPK, p21, and HBP1 may share similar pathways for differentiation, G1 progression, and possibly senescence.  The identification of p21 as a substrate for the p38 MAPK was delineated through a systematic investigation of TGFb-induced cell cycle arrest for relevant kinases and substrates. Initially, these investigators found that p21 protein levels increased by a post-transcriptional mechanism and concluded that the SAPKs p38 MAPK and JNK were involved in stabilizing the p21 protein. A specific site on p21 (serine 190) was defined for p38 MAPK-mediated stabilization (Kim et al., 2002). ",

The objective of the present study was to determine if the GPX1 protection was associated with phosphorylations of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p53 on Ser-15, two key signalling events in oxidative-stress-mediated cell death. Both Se-deficient GPX1 knockout (GPX1(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice ( n =64) were pretreated with an intraperitoneal injection of Se (as sodium selenite, 50 microg/kg body weight) 6 h before an intraperitoneal injection of paraquat (12.5 mg/kg). Liver aponecrosis, a mixed form of cell death sharing apoptosis and necrosis, was induced by paraquat in both groups of mice. However, its appearance was remarkably delayed and the severity was decreased by the repletion of hepatic GPX1 activity to <4% of the normal level by the Se injection in the WT mice, compared with that in the GPX1(-/-) mice. Consistently, the WT mice had lower levels of hepatic phospho-JNK, p53 and phospho-p53 (Ser-15) when compared with the GPX1(-/-) mice at 1-10 h after paraquat injection. Incubating liver homogenates with antibodies raised against JNK or phospho-JNK resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of phospho-p53 (Ser-15), and the amounts of the precipitated phospho-p53 were greater in the GPX1(-/-) mice when compared with that in the WT mice. The co-precipitated complex by the anti-phospho-JNK antibody was capable of phosphorylating intrinsic or extrinsic p53 on Ser-15. In conclusion, phospho-JNK may catalyse phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 in Se-deficient mouse liver under moderate oxidative stress, and attenuation of that cascade by low levels of GPX1 activity is associated with its protection against the pro-oxidant-induced liver aponecrosis.",

This led us to generate mice that overexpress K8 S73-to-Ala (S73A), which mimicked the susceptibility of K8 G61C mice to injury, thereby providing a molecular link between K8 phosphorylation and disease-associated mutation. Upon apoptotic stimulation, G61C and S73A hepatocytes have persistent and increased nonkeratin proapoptotic substrate phosphorylation by stress-activated kinases, compared with wild-type hepatocytes, in association with an inability to phosphorylate K8 S73. Our findings provide the first direct link between patient-related human keratin variants and liver disease predisposition. The highly abundant cytoskeletal protein K8, and possibly other keratins with the conserved S73-containing phosphoepitope, can protect tissue from injury by serving as a phosphate \\\"sponge\\\" for stress-activated kinases and thereby provide a novel nonmechanical function for intermediate filament proteins.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Western blot analysis revealed that JNK1 levels were significantly decreased after hyperoxia  when cells were transfected with JNK  RNAi compared to the SCR or mock controls (Fig. 5A). Whereas the transfection with the SCR RNAi resulted in minimal reduction in both JNK and IL-8 levels, inhibition of JNK did result in a significant reduction in JNK levels (Fig. 5B, p < 0.01) and IL-8 production in hyperoxia (Fig. 5C, p < 0.0001 compared to mock and SCR controls). These results indicate that AP-1 plays a central role in regulating IL-8  expression in response to hyperoxia.",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185].

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

It is highly similar to JIP1, a mouse protein known to be a regulator of cJun amino-terminal kinase (Mapk8). This protein has been shown to prevent MAPK8 mediated activation of transcription factors, and decrease IL-1 beta and MAP kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) induced apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells. This protein also functions as a DNA-binding transactivator of the glucose transporter GLUT2. RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) is reported to repress the expression of this gene in insulin-secreting beta cells. This gene is found to be mutated in a type 2 diabetes family, and thus is thought to be a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes. The phenotype of the JIP1 loss-of-function model is very similar to that of JNK1 deficiency in mice, with reduced JNK activity and increased insulin sensitivity (51). Interestingly, the JNK2 isoform plays a significant nonredundant role in atherosclerosis (52), though apparently not in type 2 diabetes. Recent studies in mice demonstrate that JNK inhibition in established diabetes or atherosclerosis might be a viable therapeutic avenue for these diseases in humans",

The roles of each JNK isoform in the many putative biological responses where the JNK pathway is activated are still unclear. To examine the cellular responses mediated by different JNK isoforms, gain-of-function JNK1 polypeptides were generated by fusing the upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MKK7, with p46JNK1alpha or p46JNK1beta. The MKK7-JNK fusion proteins, which exhibited constitutive activity in 293T cells, were stably expressed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Swiss 3T3 cells expressing either of the MKK7-JNK polypeptides were equally sensitized to induction of cell death following serum withdrawal. To search for other cellular responses that may be selectively regulated by the JNK1 isoforms, the gene expression profiles of Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1alpha or MKK7-JNK1beta were compared with empty vector-transfected control cells. Affymetrix Genechips identified 46 genes for which expression was increased in MKK7-JNK-expressing cells relative to vector control cells. Twenty genes including those for c-Jun, MKP-7, interluekin-1 receptor family member ST2L/ST2, and c-Jun-binding protein were induced similarly by MKK7-JNK1alpha and MKK7-JNK1beta proteins, whereas 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1alpha and 13 genes were selectively increased by MKK7-JNK1beta. The set of genes selectively induced by MKK7-JNK1beta included a number of known interferon-stimulated genes (ISG12, ISG15, IGTP, and GTPI). Consistent with these gene expression changes, Swiss 3T3 cells expressing MKK7-JNK1beta exhibited increased resistance to vesicular stomatitis virus-induced cell death. These findings reveal evidence for JNK isoform-selective gene regulation and support a role for distinct JNK isoforms in specific cellular responses.",

This region lies within a PEST consensus sequence that has been shown to be involved in MYC protein degradation (18, 19). Thus it is interesting to speculate that CK2, which shows enhanced expression in many tumors (15, 20), affects cell proliferation at least in part by stabilizing MYC proteins. In addition to MYC, its dimerization partner MAX is also a CK2 substrate. It is worth noting that CK2-dependent phosphorylation of MAX affects the kinetics of DNA binding of both MYC/MAX hetero- and MAX/MAX homodimers and regulates the sensitivity to caspases during apoptosis (21-23). Together this suggests that CK2-dependent phosphorylation affects the stability and the DNA binding properties of MYC/MAX complexes and possibly other dimers of the network. In addition to these two areas of phosphorylation, a third is located within the TAD of MYC (Fig. 1). Two sites, Thr-58 and Ser-62 within MBI, that are targeted by GSK3 and by proline-directed kinases, respectively, have generated particular interest (24). This was stimulated at least in part by the observations that Thr-58 and amino acids in its vicinity are frequently mutated in Burkitt lymphoma (Fig. S1G) (25). The Thr-58 and Ser-62 sites are interdependent because Ser-62 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for modification of Thr-58. Kinases implicated in Ser-62 phosphorylation include mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK),",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",
