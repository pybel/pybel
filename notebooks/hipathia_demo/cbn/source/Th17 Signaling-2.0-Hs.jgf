Dendritic cell (DC)-derived CXCL10 facilitated T cell-DC interactions in LNs during T cell priming while both chemokines guided intranodal positioning of CD4(+) T cells to interfollicular and medullary zones. Thus, different chemokines acting on the same receptor can function locally to facilitate DC-T cell interactions and globally to influence intranodal positioning, and both functions contribute to Th1 cell differentiation.",

Our microarray analysis identified genes differentially expressed between proliferating and differentiated MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Immunohistochemical analyses of RNF11 protein encoded by one of the differentially expressed genes revealed it as highly expressed in osteoblasts of multiple skeletal elements during embryonic bone formation in mice. In contrast, cartilage, undifferentiated mesenchymal tissue and osteocytes did not express detectable amounts of the RNF11 protein. The RNF11 mRNA was found to be abundant during the proliferation stage of MC3T3-E1 osteoblast development with a short second peak of expression during the mineralization phase. This pattern of expression is similar to that of the Ets1 transcription factor during osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, and we used immunohistochemistry to show that, in vivo, Ets1 protein is coexpressed with RNF11 in osteoblasts. The human and mouse RNF11 promoters each contain three Ets transcription factor binding sites (EBS) and we found that Ets1 binds specifically to one of them. The functionality of this site was tested in a transcription-transactivation assay, indicating that RNF11 expression in bone cells is regulated by the Ets1 factor. RNF11 expression in bone cells is regulated by the Ets1 factor.",

Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is one such cytokine, whose increased expression results mostly from increases in transcription. Cis-acting elements with NFkappaB, AP1 and ETS-like binding motifs have been identified in the promoter region of the GM-CSF gene, and are important or essential for transcriptional activity following T cell activation. ETS1 is a transcription factor of the ETS family that is expressed in T cells. We have previously shown that ETS1 can transactivate GM-CSF in Jurkat T cells, but only after the cells have been stimulated by treatment with PMA and ionomycin, agents that mimic T cell activation. Thus we proposed that ETS1, which is expressed constitutively in Jurkat cells, may act in concert with PMA/ionomycin inducible factors. Here we show that ETS1 can transactivate a GM-CSF reporter construct in unstimulated Jurkat cells, providing that either NFkappaB or AP1 transcription factors are supplied by co-transfection. We confirm that binding of endogenous NFkappaB and AP1 is induced following PMA/ionomycin treatment of T cells. Transactivation by ETS1, NFkappaB and AP1 is synergistic, and mutation of the individual binding sites reveals that the transcriptional activities of these factors are interdependent. Our results suggest that constitutive ETS1, and inducible NFkappaB and AP1, cooperate as part of a higher order transcriptional complex in activated T cells.",

Consistent with our data that PI3K/Akt activation is upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO during A-R (Fig. 2C), when we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, CO lost its ability to decrease STAT1 and increase STAT3 activation during A-R (Fig. 2D, lane 4).

The arrays were analyzed using MAS 5.0 (Affymetrix) with the default parameters for the statistical algorithm and probe set scaling (set to 500). The data were then filtered so that the absolute value of the fold change was >2.0 and the change P value was <0.001.

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

Holbro and N.E. Hynes, unpublished data). As a consequence, these cells have decreased PI-3K/PKB signaling, a reduction in D-type cyclin levels, and show an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A main effector of ErbB signaling, the PI-3K/PKB pathway, is particularly important in mediating cell survival 103 T. Holbro et al. / Experimental Cell Research 284 (2003) 99-110 since several PKB substrates directly control various apoptotic processes. The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

The differentiation of T helper 17 (TH17) cells is initiated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), downstream of interleukin-6 (IL-6)- and IL-21-induced signalling. Activation of STAT3 induces the expression of retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-alpha (RORalpha) and RORgammat. These two factors establish the TH17-cell-associated gene-expression programme, leading to the production of IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22. STAT5, which is downstream of IL-2 signalling, and STAT1, which is downstream of IL-27 signalling, as well as ETS1, are negative regulators of TH17-cell differentiation. In addition, the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), which is induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signalling, antagonizes the TH17-cell developmental programme.

We show that the kinase domains of FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4 containing the activation loop mutation, when targeted to the plasma membrane by a myristylation signal, can transform NIH3T3 cells and induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Phosphorylation of Shp2, PLC-gamma, and MAPK was also stimulated by all three 'TDII-like' FGFR derivatives. Additionally, activation of Stat1 and Stat3 was observed in cells expressing the activated FGFR derivatives.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha has defined proinflammatory roles in Crohn's disease but its role in fibrosis is unclear. We tested the hypothesis that TNFalpha increases collagen accumulation and proliferation in intestinal myofibroblasts and has additive effects in combination with insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I. The mechanisms, TNF receptor isoform, and downstream signaling pathways were examined. Intestinal myofibroblasts from wild-type (WT) mice or mice homozygous for disruption of genes encoding TNFR1 (TNFR1-/-), TNFR2 (TNFR2-/-), or both (TNFR1/2-/-), were treated with TNFalpha, IGF-I, or both. In WT cells, TNFalpha and IGF-I stimulated type I collagen accumulation and DNA synthesis in an additive manner. IGF-I, but not TNFalpha, stimulated type I collagen gene activation. TNFalpha, but not IGF-I, induced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) expression and reduced matrix metalloproteinases-2 activity and collagen degradation. TNFalpha also activated ERK1/2. These responses to TNFalpha were absent in TNFR2-/- and TNFR1/2-/- myofibroblasts, whereas TNFR1-/- cells showed similar responses to WT. Inhibition of ERK1/2 diminished TNFalpha induced DNA synthesis in WT and TNFR1-/- cells. Differences in TNFalpha-induced STAT3/DNA binding activity and not NFkappaB and AP-1 transcriptional activation correlated with impaired collagen accumulation/TIMP-1 induction in TNFR2(-/-) cells. Constitutively active STAT3 rescued TIMP-1 expression in TNFR2-/- cells. We conclude that TNFalpha and IGF-I may additively contribute to fibrosis during intestinal inflammation. TNFR2 is a primary mediator of fibrogenic actions of TNFalpha acting through ERK1/2 to stimulate proliferation and through STAT3 to stimulate TIMP-1 and inhibit collagen degradation.",

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and expression of a dominant-negative Stat3 mutant, we show that activation of Stat3 and its binding to the p21 promoter are required for DEP-induced expression of p21, suggesting that Stat3 plays an essential role in the induction of p21 by DEP.",

STATs were thought to exist as latent, cytoplasmic monomers and activation to require dimer formation was mediated exclusively by reciprocal phospho-tyrosine/SH2-domain interactions, but recent evidence of cytoplasmic STAT complexes, including dimers, and unphosphorylated STATs in the nucleus has challenged these notions. STAT complexes detected by conventional SDS-PAGE, including a STAT3 dimer, have been reported. We show that such complexes can form during cell lysis and be disrupted with DTT, suggesting inter-chain disulphide bridging. STAT3 also forms a related complex in cells upon oxidative stress. We map the interaction to the amino-terminal domain of STAT3 and use mass spectrometry to implicate cysteine 259 as the reactive residue. The redox sensitivity of STAT3 may be significant, given its activation in cells in response to reactive oxygen species.",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

However, CNTF has also been shown to cause weight loss in a variety of rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes, whereas a modified form also causes weight loss in humans. CNTF administration can correct or improve hyperinsulinemia, hyperphagia, and hyperlipidemia associated with these models of obesity. In order to investigate the effects of CNTF on fat cells, we examined the expression of CNTF receptor complex proteins (LIFR, gp130, and CNTFRalpha) during adipocyte differentiation and the effects of CNTF on STAT, Akt, and MAPK activation. We also examined the ability of CNTF to regulate the expression of adipocyte transcription factors and other adipogenic proteins. Our studies clearly demonstrate that the expression of two of the three CNTF receptor complex components, CNTFRalpha and LIFR, decreases during adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, gp130 expression is relatively unaffected by differentiation. In addition, preadipocytes are more sensitive to CNTF treatment than adipocytes, as judged by both STAT 3 and Akt activation. Despite decreased levels of CNTFRalpha expression in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, CNTF treatment of these cells resulted in a time-dependent activation of STAT 3. Chronic treatment of adipocytes resulted in a substantial decrease in fatty-acid synthase and a notable decline in SREBP-1 levels but had no effect on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, acrp30, adipocyte-expressed STAT proteins, or C/EBPalpha. However, CNTF resulted in a significant increase in IRS-1 expression. CNTFRalpha receptor expression was substantially induced in the fat pads of four rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes as compared with lean littermates. Moreover, we demonstrated that CNTF can activate STAT 3 in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle in vivo. In summary, CNTF affects adipocyte gene expression, and the specific receptor for this cytokine is induced in rodent models of obesity/type II diabetes.",

Holbro and N.E. Hynes, unpublished data). As a consequence, these cells have decreased PI-3K/PKB signaling, a reduction in D-type cyclin levels, and show an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A main effector of ErbB signaling, the PI-3K/PKB pathway, is particularly important in mediating cell survival 103 T. Holbro et al. / Experimental Cell Research 284 (2003) 99-110 since several PKB substrates directly control various apoptotic processes. The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

We found that treatment of adult male mice by ISO (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) caused a delayed STAT3 activation (at 60-120 min), which was fully abolished by beta-AR antagonist, propranolol. ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly enhanced by phosphodiesterase inhibitor amrinone, indicating that cAMP is critically involved in beta-AR-mediated STAT3 activation. In addition, beta-AR stimulation significantly increased gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1). IL-6 protein levels in serum and mouse myocardium were also significantly increased in response to ISO treatment. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, IL-6 level was enhanced significantly after ISO (10-6 mol/liter) stimulation for 2 h and then peaked at 12 h, whereas the response of IL-6 in cultured cardiomyocytes to ISO stimulation was not significant, suggesting that ISO-induced increase in IL-6 is primarily from cardiac fibroblasts rather than cardiomyocytes. Most importantly, IL-6 could activate STAT3 in a time-dependent manner in cultured cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of IL-6 level by anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibody clearly attenuated ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in myocardium. Taken together, these results indicate that beta-AR stimulation leads to a delayed STAT3 activation via an IL-6 family of cytokine-mediated pathway and that cardiac fibroblasts, but not cardiomyocytes, is probably the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium.",

              "summary_text": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are important modulators of cell growth under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We and others have previously shown that these growth factors increase insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) number and mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells and that this effect is transcriptionally regulated. To study the mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved, IGF-1R promoter reporter constructs were transiently transfected in CHO-AT1 cells that overexpress angiotensin AT1 receptors. Our findings indicate that Ang II and bFGF significantly increased IGF-1R promoter activity up to 7- and 3-fold, respectively. The effect induced by Ang II was mediated via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism, since tyrphostin A25 largely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in promoter activity. In addition, co-transfection of dominant negative Ras, Raf, and MEK1 or pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 dose-dependently decreased both the Ang II- and bFGF-induced increase in IGF-1R transcription and protein expression, suggesting that the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathway is required for both growth factors. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to act as second messengers in Ang II-induced signaling, and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is redox-sensitive. While co-transfection of dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant completely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in transcription, it had no effect on the bFGF signaling. In contrast, co-transfection studies indicated that the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, and c-Jun and the Janus kinase 2 kinase are required in the signaling pathway of bFGF, whereas only dominant c-Jun inhibited the Ang II-induced effect. In summary, these data demonstrate that Ang II and bFGF increase IGF-1R gene transcription via distinct as well as shared pathways and have important implications for understanding growth-stimulatory effects of these growth factors on vascular cells.",

Furthermore, it is shown that Nhlh2 binds to E-box motifs found adjacent to STAT3 sites in the PC1/3 promoter both in vitro and in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Finally, two different protein-protein interaction assays confirm the presence of a STAT3:Nhlh2 heterodimer on the PC1/3 promoter. The Nhlh2:STAT3 heterodimer may be an important transcriptional regulator of other hypothalamic genes in the leptin signaling pathway. These data confirm Nhlh2 as an integral element of the Janus kinase/STAT signaling pathway and are the first to demonstrate coordinated control of PC1/3 transcription by Nhlh2 and STAT3 after leptin stimulation.",

              "summary_text": "In the rat pineal gland, prominent expression of serine protease inhibitor 3 (SPI-3) mRNA is seen after systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide. The up-regulation of SPI-3 mRNA expression is also confirmed by northern blotting. Most SPI-3 mRNA-positive cells simultaneously express synaptophysin, a marker for pinealocytes, but not glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker for astrocytes. This indicates that SPI-3 mRNA-positive cells are pinealocytes. Almost all SPI-3 mRNA-positive cells also showed translocation of the signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) into nuclei after lipopolysaccharide injection. These data support previous in vitro results that SPI-3 expression is induced in a STAT3-mediated manner. In addition, the expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) mRNAs, but not of interleukin 6 receptor mRNA, was up-regulated after systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment. Because these receptors are upstream of STAT3, the present results suggest that cytokines such as LIF and/or CNTF induce SPI-3 expression via STAT3 in the pineal gland in response to inflammatory stimulus. We conclude that although the functional consequences of SPI-3 in the pineal gland during systemic inflammation are unknown, SPI-3 may have a crucial role in preventing some degenerative proteolysis induced by inflammatory stimuli.",

Here, we evaluate the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to a panel of genetically diverse R5 and X4 envelope proteins. Modulation of gene expression was evaluated by using oligonucleotide microarrays. Activation of transcription factors was evaluated by using an array of oligonucleotides encoding transcription factor binding sites. Responses were strongly influenced by coreceptor specificity. Treatment of cells from CCR5delta32 homozygous donors with glycoprotein (gp)120 derived from an R5 virus demonstrated that the majority of responses elicited by R5 envelopes required engagement of CCR5. R5 envelopes, to a greater extent than X4 envelopes, induced the expression of genes belonging to mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathways and genes regulating the cell cycle. A number of genes induced by R5, but not X4, envelopes were also up-regulated in the resting CD4+ T cell population of HIV-infected individuals. These results suggest that R5 envelope facilitates replication of HIV in the pool of resting CD4+ T cells. Additionally, signaling by R5 gp120 may facilitate the transmission of R5 viruses by inducing a permissive environment for HIV replication.",

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

We and others have previously shown that these growth factors increase insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) number and mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells and that this effect is transcriptionally regulated. To study the mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved, IGF-1R promoter reporter constructs were transiently transfected in CHO-AT1 cells that overexpress angiotensin AT1 receptors. Our findings indicate that Ang II and bFGF significantly increased IGF-1R promoter activity up to 7- and 3-fold, respectively. The effect induced by Ang II was mediated via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism, since tyrphostin A25 largely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in promoter activity. In addition, co-transfection of dominant negative Ras, Raf, and MEK1 or pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 dose-dependently decreased both the Ang II- and bFGF-induced increase in IGF-1R transcription and protein expression, suggesting that the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathway is required for both growth factors. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to act as second messengers in Ang II-induced signaling, and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is redox-sensitive. While co-transfection of dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant completely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in transcription, it had no effect on the bFGF signaling. In contrast, co-transfection studies indicated that the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, and c-Jun and the Janus kinase 2 kinase are required in the signaling pathway of bFGF, whereas only dominant c-Jun inhibited the Ang II-induced effect. In summary, these data demonstrate that Ang II and bFGF increase IGF-1R gene transcription via distinct as well as shared pathways and have important implications for understanding growth-stimulatory effects of these growth factors on vascular cells.",

Similarly, 15(S)-HETE activated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-5B in a time-dependent manner. Dominant-negative mutant-mediated interference of STAT-5B activation suppressed 15(S)-HETE-induced HRMVEC migration and tube formation and Matrigel plug angiogenesis. The 15(S)-HETE induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in Jak2-STAT-5B-dependent manner in HRMVECs. In addition, neutralizing anti-IL-8 antibodies reduced 15(S)-HETE-induced HRMVEC migration and tube formation and Matrigel plug angiogenesis. Cloning and Transfac analysis of IL-8 promoter revealed the presence of 1 putative STAT-binding sequence at -476 nt, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed the binding of STAT-5B to this site in response to 15(S)-HETE. Mutational analysis showed that STAT binding site is essential for 15(S)-HETE-induced IL-8 promoter activity.

AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

The Src homology-2 domain mutant of Chat-H loses this signal modulating activity.",

The reduction was even more pronounced on days 3 and 5 of stimulation (Fig. 3 A, B). As reported (26) , we found a down-regulation of TGF-bRII transcripts after CD3/CD28 activation. TGF-bRI expression was unchanged under these conditions, whereas IL-10 expression used as a positive control was enhanced.",

In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors. This protein can also be phosphorylated by activin type 1 receptor kinase, and mediates the signal from the activin.

Binding of TGF-? to its type II receptor in concert with the type I receptor (A) leads to formation of a receptor complex and phosphorylation of the type I receptor. The type I receptor subsequently phosphorylates Smad2 or 3 (B), allowing this complex to associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus (C). In the nucleus, the Smad complex associates with a transcription factor and this complex binds to specific enhancers in target genes (down-) regulating transcription (D). TNF is able to interfere with TGF-? signaling through the upregulation of the inhibitory Smad7 protein (E). Smad7 is capable of inhibiting the Smad2 and 3 phosphorylating process by competing with the receptor interaction but Smad7 also can dephosphorylate the complex. In addition, Smad7 itself is capable to upregulate TGF? gene expression. As described in the discussion, CSE is most likely capable to interfere with the Smad pathway although this is not yet fully elucidated. (F). Phosphorylated Smad3 is able to stimulate the transcription of the decorin gene (G).",

We pretreated PAEC with SB203580 and observed that CO can no longer modulate STAT1 or STAT3 activation (Fig. 2D, lane 5). Consistent with our data that PI3K/Akt activation is upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO during A-R (Fig. 2C), when we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, CO lost its ability to decrease STAT1 and increase STAT3 activation during A-R (Fig. 2D, lane 4). These data demonstrated that the opposing effect of CO on STAT1 and STAT3 activation is dependent upon PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. ",

              "summary_text": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are important modulators of cell growth under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We and others have previously shown that these growth factors increase insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) number and mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells and that this effect is transcriptionally regulated. To study the mechanisms and the signaling pathways involved, IGF-1R promoter reporter constructs were transiently transfected in CHO-AT1 cells that overexpress angiotensin AT1 receptors. Our findings indicate that Ang II and bFGF significantly increased IGF-1R promoter activity up to 7- and 3-fold, respectively. The effect induced by Ang II was mediated via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism, since tyrphostin A25 largely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in promoter activity. In addition, co-transfection of dominant negative Ras, Raf, and MEK1 or pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 dose-dependently decreased both the Ang II- and bFGF-induced increase in IGF-1R transcription and protein expression, suggesting that the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathway is required for both growth factors. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to act as second messengers in Ang II-induced signaling, and activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB is redox-sensitive. While co-transfection of dominant negative IkappaBalpha mutant completely inhibited the Ang II-induced increase in transcription, it had no effect on the bFGF signaling. In contrast, co-transfection studies indicated that the transcription factors STAT1, STAT3, and c-Jun and the Janus kinase 2 kinase are required in the signaling pathway of bFGF, whereas only dominant c-Jun inhibited the Ang II-induced effect. In summary, these data demonstrate that Ang II and bFGF increase IGF-1R gene transcription via distinct as well as shared pathways and have important implications for understanding growth-stimulatory effects of these growth factors on vascular cells.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

Signal transduction involves the presenilin-dependent intracellular processing of Notch and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain of Notch, Notch-IC. Notch-IC associates with the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jkappa/CBF-1 to activate transcription of Notch target genes. In the absence of Notch signalling, RBP-Jkappa/CBF-1 acts as a transcriptional repressor through the recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) corepressor complexes. We identified SHARP as an RBP-Jkappa/CBF-1-interacting corepressor in a yeast two-hybrid screen. In cotransfection experiments, SHARP-mediated repression was sensitive to the HDAC inhibitor TSA and facilitated by SKIP, a highly conserved SMRT and RBP-Jkappa-interacting protein. SHARP repressed Hairy/Enhancer of split (HES)-1 promoter activity, inhibited Notch-1-mediated transactivation and rescued Notch-1-induced inhibition of primary neurogenesis in Xenopus laevis embryos. Based on our data, we propose a model in which SHARP is a novel component of the HDAC corepressor complex, recruited by RBP-Jkappa to repress transcription of target genes in the absence of activated Notch. Notch-IC associates with the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jkappa/CBF-1 to activate transcription of Notch target genes.",

              "summary_text": "One of the hallmarks of regenerating myofibers is the centrally located position of the myonuclei; upon maturing, muscle fiber nuclei are located along the cell periphery [4]. Notably, repeated cycles of injury and regeneration do not appear to deplete satellite cell numbers, suggesting that these cells have the ability to self-renew [2]. Satellite cells were initially identified in frog leg muscles by electron microscopy [1], and subsequently have been identified in all higher vertebrates. In humans and mice, these quiescent [18], non-fibrillar, mononuclear cells are most plentiful at birth (estimated at 32% of sublaminar nuclei) [19]. The frequency declines post-natally, stabilizing to between 1 to 5% of skeletal muscle nuclei in adult mice [2]. Satellite cell frequency varies in different muscles, likely as a function of variation in fiber type composition (i.e. slow oxidative, fast oxidative, or fast glycolytic fibers). For example, the mouse soleus muscle, which is predominantly made up of slow oxidative fibers, has a higher number of satellite cells than the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, which primarily contains fast glycolytic fibers. Additionally, the absolute numbers of satellite cells increases in the soleus but not the EDL between 1 and 12 months of age, although the proportion of satellite cells decreases in both muscle types with increasing age [20]. In humans, the proportion of satellite cells in skeletal muscles also decreases with age, which may explain the decreased efficiency of muscle regeneration in older subjects [21]. Satellite cells from aged muscle also display reduced proliferative and fusion capacity, as well as a tendency to accumulate fat, all of which likely contribute to deteriorating regeneration capability [22,23]. That endurance training can offset the decline in satellite cell number with age suggests that poorer regeneration is not simply a result of limited replicative potential of older satellite cells [24]. Several signals and growth factors have been implicated in promotion of satellite cell activation and proliferation (Figure 1). For example, the Notch signaling pathway, which is activated upon muscle injury, regulates satellite cell transition from quiescence to proliferation in single fiber cultures, thereby expanding the myoblast population in injured muscle [25].",

High levels of IL-2Ralpha provide a mean for continual capture of IL-2 to sustain signaling whereas limiting IL-15Ralpha tempers engagement of CD122 and gamma C, limiting signal transduction. Thus, varied levels of IL-2Ralpha and IL-15Ralpha provide a simple, yet powerful, mechanism to quantify and tune signaling through common intermediates leading to distinctive biological responses.",

Binding of TGF-? to its type II receptor in concert with the type I receptor (A) leads to formation of a receptor complex and phosphorylation of the type I receptor. The type I receptor subsequently phosphorylates Smad2 or 3 (B), allowing this complex to associate with Smad4 and move into the nucleus (C). In the nucleus, the Smad complex associates with a transcription factor and this complex binds to specific enhancers in target genes (down-) regulating transcription (D). TNF is able to interfere with TGF-? signaling through the upregulation of the inhibitory Smad7 protein (E). Smad7 is capable of inhibiting the Smad2 and 3 phosphorylating process by competing with the receptor interaction but Smad7 also can dephosphorylate the complex. In addition, Smad7 itself is capable to upregulate TGF? gene expression. As described in the discussion, CSE is most likely capable to interfere with the Smad pathway although this is not yet fully elucidated. (F). Phosphorylated Smad3 is able to stimulate the transcription of the decorin gene (G).",

In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors.

In CTLA-4-deficient mice, disease induction requires CD28 enhancement of TCR signaling by autoreactive TCR specificities with presumably high affinity for self-ligands, because disease induction is delayed by in vivo expression of transgenic TCRs with low affinity for self ligands (26, 27). Thus, we think that the importance of an intact Lck binding motif in the CD28 cytosolic tail for disease induction in CTLA-4-deficient mice reflects the fact that, by increasing the residency time of Lck in the immunological synapse, CD28 costimulation specifically increases the intensity and duration of in vivo TCR signaling by T cells with autoreactive TCR specificities.

For example, only phosphorylated (but not non-phosphorylated) peptides spanning either Tyr-392 or Tyr-510 of IL-2Rbeta can efficiently compete with IL-2-induced Stat5 DNA binding to a GAS motif  IL-2-mediated hetero-dimerization of its receptor triggers a rapid increase in the recruitment of Jak3 and activation of both Jak1 and Jak3 (Johnston et al., 1994; Witthuhn et al., 1994). These kinases phosphorylate the receptor as well as each other, and activate other signaling molecules associated with the receptor.

Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis.
