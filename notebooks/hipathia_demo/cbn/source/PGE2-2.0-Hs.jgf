If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. If COPD studies were not found, we expanded our inclusion criteria to studies from healthy context and incorporated mechanisms active in processes implicated in COPD into the disease models. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

              "summary_text": "Mechanisms of cancer promotion by COX-2 are not fully understood, but signaling through prostaglandin (PG)E2 receptors is a contributing factor. The major PGE2 receptors on epithelial cells, EP2 and EP4, increase cAMP production, which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in some cell types.  To explore the hypothesis that PGE2-stimulated cAMP  is a key intracellular mediator of COX-2-dependent antiapoptosis and define the underlying mechanisms, we used the T84 human colon epithelial cell line, which exhibits inducible apoptosis and is responsive to PGE2  stimulation (31, 34, 35). The major PGE2 receptors on colon epithelial cells are EP2 and EP4  (25), a finding we confirmed by RT-PCR of T84 cells (data not shown). Both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP as a second messenger, suggesting that cAMP mediates antiapoptotic functions in epithelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that a membrane-permeant  cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, and CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs regulatory protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl  cyclase, also inhibited Fas- and staurosporine-promoted apoptosis  (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by evidence that CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP also inhibited the formation of apoptosis-associated DNA laddering in T84 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We obtained similar results with the normal rat intestinal epithelial  cell line, RIE-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antiapoptotic response to increases in cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells is independent of their state of transformation and conserved across at least two species.\\\"From full text\\\"",

Here we report a new PLC and calcium signalling pathway that is triggered by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and mediated by a small GTPase of the Rap family. Activation of the adenylyl cyclase-coupled beta2-adrenoceptor expressed in HEK-293 cells or the endogenous receptor for prostaglandin E1 in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells induced calcium mobilization and PLC stimulation, seemingly caused by cAMP formation, but was independent of protein kinase A (PKA). We provide evidence that these receptor responses are mediated by a Rap GTPase, specifically Rap2B, activated by a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (Epac) regulated by cAMP, and involve the recently identified PLC-epsilon isoform.",

              "summary_text": "Mechanisms of cancer promotion by COX-2 are not fully understood, but signaling through prostaglandin (PG)E2 receptors is a contributing factor. The major PGE2 receptors on epithelial cells, EP2 and EP4, increase cAMP production, which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in some cell types.  To explore the hypothesis that PGE2-stimulated cAMP  is a key intracellular mediator of COX-2-dependent antiapoptosis and define the underlying mechanisms, we used the T84 human colon epithelial cell line, which exhibits inducible apoptosis and is responsive to PGE2  stimulation (31, 34, 35). The major PGE2 receptors on colon epithelial cells are EP2 and EP4  (25), a finding we confirmed by RT-PCR of T84 cells (data not shown). Both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP as a second messenger, suggesting that cAMP mediates antiapoptotic functions in epithelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that a membrane-permeant  cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, and CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs regulatory protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl  cyclase, also inhibited Fas- and staurosporine-promoted apoptosis  (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by evidence that CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP also inhibited the formation of apoptosis-associated DNA laddering in T84 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We obtained similar results with the normal rat intestinal epithelial  cell line, RIE-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antiapoptotic response to increases in cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells is independent of their state of transformation and conserved across at least two species.\\\"From full text\\\"",

              "summary_text": "Mechanisms of cancer promotion by COX-2 are not fully understood, but signaling through prostaglandin (PG)E2 receptors is a contributing factor. The major PGE2 receptors on epithelial cells, EP2 and EP4, increase cAMP production, which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in some cell types.  To explore the hypothesis that PGE2-stimulated cAMP  is a key intracellular mediator of COX-2-dependent antiapoptosis and define the underlying mechanisms, we used the T84 human colon epithelial cell line, which exhibits inducible apoptosis and is responsive to PGE2  stimulation (31, 34, 35). The major PGE2 receptors on colon epithelial cells are EP2 and EP4  (25), a finding we confirmed by RT-PCR of T84 cells (data not shown). Both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP as a second messenger, suggesting that cAMP mediates antiapoptotic functions in epithelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that a membrane-permeant  cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, and CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs regulatory protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl  cyclase, also inhibited Fas- and staurosporine-promoted apoptosis  (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by evidence that CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP also inhibited the formation of apoptosis-associated DNA laddering in T84 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We obtained similar results with the normal rat intestinal epithelial  cell line, RIE-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antiapoptotic response to increases in cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells is independent of their state of transformation and conserved across at least two species.\\\"From full text\\\"",

              "summary_text": "Mechanisms of cancer promotion by COX-2 are not fully understood, but signaling through prostaglandin (PG)E2 receptors is a contributing factor. The major PGE2 receptors on epithelial cells, EP2 and EP4, increase cAMP production, which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in some cell types.  To explore the hypothesis that PGE2-stimulated cAMP  is a key intracellular mediator of COX-2-dependent antiapoptosis and define the underlying mechanisms, we used the T84 human colon epithelial cell line, which exhibits inducible apoptosis and is responsive to PGE2  stimulation (31, 34, 35). The major PGE2 receptors on colon epithelial cells are EP2 and EP4  (25), a finding we confirmed by RT-PCR of T84 cells (data not shown). Both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP as a second messenger, suggesting that cAMP mediates antiapoptotic functions in epithelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that a membrane-permeant  cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, and CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs regulatory protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl  cyclase, also inhibited Fas- and staurosporine-promoted apoptosis  (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by evidence that CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP also inhibited the formation of apoptosis-associated DNA laddering in T84 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We obtained similar results with the normal rat intestinal epithelial  cell line, RIE-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antiapoptotic response to increases in cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells is independent of their state of transformation and conserved across at least two species.\\\"From full text\\\"",

              "summary_text": "as shown in Figure 2.95-98 In essence, the activation status of Raf depends on the integration of both activating and inhibitory stimuli, the net result of which determines the downstream messages. THE RAF FAMILY OF GENES AND PROTEINS The raf family of genes was first identified as oncogenes in retroviruses that are the causative vectors of tumors in mice and chicken.99,100 The first raf gene to be identified, v-raf, the transforming gene of the mouse sarcoma virus 3611, induces fibrosarcomas and erythroleukemia in newborn mice, and C-raf (also called raf-1) is its proto-oncogene homolog.101,102 A-raf was found next by screening a mouse spleen cDNA library at low stringency with a v-raf probe. Next, v-Rmil was identified as the transforming gene in the avian retrovirus Mill Hill No. 2 (MH2) from a spontaneous ovarian tumor and found to be homologous to v-raf.99 C-Rmil corresponded to a third mammalian raf gene, B-raf, which was also shown to be an oncogene.103,104 However, initial attempts to identify activated versions of raf in human cancers failed to demonstrate unique DNA rearrangements in any specific tumor type, which, in retrospect, can be attributed to the lack of requisite sensitivity of early assays to detect single point mutations. Furthermore, most early efforts were directed at C-raf, rather than at the more oncogenic B-raf. The mammalian raf family consists of the following three genes: A-raf, B-raf, and C-raf, which are located on chromosomes Xp11, 7q32, and 3p25, respectively. The raf proto-oncogenes encode three 68- to 74-kd cytosolic proteins, termed A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf (Raf-1), which share highly conserved amino-terminal regulatory regions and catalytic domains at the carboxyl terminus (Fig 4).10 As serine/threonine kinases, Raf proteins phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on essential modulatory proteins downstream of Ras. Each Raf species has a distinct expression profile in tissues, which suggests that individual Raf isoforms perform clearly defined functions.4 C-Raf is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues. Both A- and B-Raf have more restricted expression profiles than C-Raf, with A-Raf overexpressed in urogenital tissues (eg, kidney, ovary, prostate, and epididymis) and B-Raf overexpressed in neural, testicular, splenic, and hematopoietic tissues.105 Unlike A-raf and C-raf, B-raf undergoes differential splicing in exons 8b and 10a, and its spliced variants are translated into 10 B-Raf isoforms.106,107 Both A-Raf and C-Raf undergo localization to the mitochondria, which supports the notion that Raf regulates apoptosis, but the specific proportions of Raf isoforms that are localized to the mitochondria are not known.108-112 This localization may be a result of isoform-specific lipid- or protein-binding partners, which recruit Raf to distinct membrane rafts. From a functional standpoint, although all Raf proteins are serine/threonine kinases and capable of activating the MAPK cascade, they have distinct downstream phosphorylation targets and play unique roles in signaling.113 Their distinct roles are supported by Raf knockout studies, in which mice lacking each of the three Raf proteins have disparate phenotypes.113,114 B-raf knockouts die in utero by day 12, usually as a result of massive internal hemorrhage, whereas A-raf and C-raf knockouts die postpartum with extensive intestinal distension (A-raf knockout) or failure of lung maturation (C-raf knockout). Additional support for the diverse functionality of Raf family members is provided by the disparate responses of B-Raf and C-Raf to identical stimuli, as well as the distinct messages that each isoform relays downstream to Rap1, which is a small GTPase that functions as both an activator and repressor of Raf.115 For example, Rap1- mediated stimulation of B-Raf by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) phosphorylates ERK, whereas stimulation of C-Raf inhibits ERK phosphorylation.115",

Here we report a new PLC and calcium signalling pathway that is triggered by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and mediated by a small GTPase of the Rap family. Activation of the adenylyl cyclase-coupled beta2-adrenoceptor expressed in HEK-293 cells or the endogenous receptor for prostaglandin E1 in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells induced calcium mobilization and PLC stimulation, seemingly caused by cAMP formation, but was independent of protein kinase A (PKA). We provide evidence that these receptor responses are mediated by a Rap GTPase, specifically Rap2B, activated by a guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (Epac) regulated by cAMP, and involve the recently identified PLC-epsilon isoform.",

The major PGE2 receptors on epithelial cells, EP2 and EP4, increase cAMP production, which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in some cell types.  To explore the hypothesis that PGE2-stimulated cAMP  is a key intracellular mediator of COX-2-dependent antiapoptosis and define the underlying mechanisms, we used the T84 human colon epithelial cell line, which exhibits inducible apoptosis and is responsive to PGE2  stimulation (31, 34, 35). The major PGE2 receptors on colon epithelial cells are EP2 and EP4  (25), a finding we confirmed by RT-PCR of T84 cells (data not shown). Both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP as a second messenger, suggesting that cAMP mediates antiapoptotic functions in epithelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that a membrane-permeant  cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, and CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs regulatory protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl  cyclase, also inhibited Fas- and staurosporine-promoted apoptosis  (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by evidence that CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP also inhibited the formation of apoptosis-associated DNA laddering in T84 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We obtained similar results with the normal rat intestinal epithelial  cell line, RIE-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antiapoptotic response to increases in cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells is independent of their state of transformation and conserved across at least two species.\\\"From full text\\\"",

As shown in Fig. 2, the fibroblast strains incubated with 1% CSE had a three- to fourfold induction in PGE2 synthesis over basal levels after 24 h, depending on the strain. However, cells treated with both CSE and NS-398 had significantly decreased PGE2 levels relative to fibroblasts treated with CSE alone, supporting the idea that the elevated PGE2 levels are a result of COX-2 activity.

It is also expressed in normal tissues of the liver and kidney where it functions to actively transport lipophilic xenobiotics. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis confirmed the results of the microarray, showing increased mRNA levels for MDR1 in Cox-2 overexpressing cells.e again confirm that Cox-2 overexpressing RMC have increased MDR1 expression. We also observed that the addition of NS398 blocked the up-regulation of the MDR1 protein, consistent with the R123 efflux assay showing reduced MDR1 activity.

The major PGE2 receptors on epithelial cells, EP2 and EP4, increase cAMP production, which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in some cell types.  To explore the hypothesis that PGE2-stimulated cAMP  is a key intracellular mediator of COX-2-dependent antiapoptosis and define the underlying mechanisms, we used the T84 human colon epithelial cell line, which exhibits inducible apoptosis and is responsive to PGE2  stimulation (31, 34, 35). The major PGE2 receptors on colon epithelial cells are EP2 and EP4  (25), a finding we confirmed by RT-PCR of T84 cells (data not shown). Both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP as a second messenger, suggesting that cAMP mediates antiapoptotic functions in epithelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that a membrane-permeant  cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, and CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs regulatory protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl  cyclase, also inhibited Fas- and staurosporine-promoted apoptosis  (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by evidence that CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP also inhibited the formation of apoptosis-associated DNA laddering in T84 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We obtained similar results with the normal rat intestinal epithelial  cell line, RIE-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antiapoptotic response to increases in cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells is independent of their state of transformation and conserved across at least two species.\\\"From full text\\\"",

We identified 147 genes whose levels of expression were significantly altered in RNA obtained from cells demonstrating a transformed phenotype with stable GLI1 expression or stable Ha-ras expression. Comparison of expression profiles from GLI1- and Ha-ras-expressing cells established a set of genes unique to GLI1-induced cell transformation. Thirty genes were altered by stable GLI1 expression, and 124 genes were changed by stable Ha-ras expression. Seven genes had altered expression levels in both GLI1- and Ha-ras-expressing cells. Genes whose expression was altered by GLI1 included cell cycle genes, cell adhesion genes, signal transduction genes, and genes regulating apoptosis. GLI1 consensus DNA-binding sequences were identified in the 5' regions of cyclin D2, IGFBP-6, osteopontin, and plakoglobin, suggesting that these genes represent immediate downstream targets. Gel shift analysis confirmed the ability of the GLI1 protein to bind these sequences. Up-regulation of cyclin D2 and down-regulation of plakoglobin were demonstrated in GLI1-amplified compared with non-amplified human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Many of the GLI1 targets with known function identified in this study increase cell proliferation, indicating that GLI1-induced cell transformation occurs through multiple downstream pathways.",

              "summary_text": "Therefore, the apoptotic effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy on proliferating vascular endothelium could contribute to the anti-tumor efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo. While it is relatively simple, however, to study chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells or tumor cells separately in vitro, it is not trivial to analyze apoptosis in these two populations when they are crowded together in a tumor. Browder et al. approached this problem by carrying out animal experiments in which the apoptotic effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on endothelial cells in a tumor bed was dissociated from the apoptotic effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy on tumor cells supported by these endothelial cells [35]. Browder et al. hypothesized, that the tradition of administering chemotherapy at maximum tolerated dose (MTD), required a treatment-free interval to allow recovery of the bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract. During the treatment-free interval, microvascular endothelial cells in the tumor bed could resume their proliferation and support tumor regrowth. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with cyclophosphamide at a conventional maximum tolerated dose followed by a 21-day interval to rescue bone marrow, ('conventional schedule'), tumors recurred after each cycle. All animals eventually died of large tumors which had a diminished response to cyclophosphamide after each cycle, i.e. the tumors developed acquired drug resistance. In contrast, if cyclophosphamide was administered more frequently and at lower doses ('antiangiogenic schedule'), without a prolonged treatment-free interval, all tumors regressed and all animals survived without bone marrow suppression or other toxicity. Then the tumors were made drug-resistant to cyclophosphamide. On the 'conventional schedule', animals died even more rapidly with large tumors as drug resistant tumor cells continued to proliferate unaffected by cyclophosphamide. However, the 'antiangiogenic schedule' significantly inhibited tumor growth, but there was still very slow tumor growth. It was not possible to raise the low dose of cyclophosphamide to a level sufficient to induce apoptosis of the remaining endothelial cells in the tumor bed, without provoking bone marrow suppression. Therefore, a low dose of a pure angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470 was added. This inhibitor by itself could not slow this tumor by more than 65%. However, when combined with cyclophosphamide on the antiangiogenic schedule, there was complete tumor regression and long-term survival in all but one animal. Immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 3) revealed extensive endothelial apoptosis that preceded tumor cell apoptosis by 4-5 days, despite the fact that the tumor cells were resistant to cyclophosphamide and not directly affected by TNP-470. This experiment reveals an endothelial-dependence of cytotoxic chemotherapy that is concealed before tumor cells have acquired drug resistance. Klement et al. obtained similar results by administering continuous low dose vinblastine to tumor-bearing mice in combination with a VEGF receptor antibody [36]. Furthermore, these results might also help to explain why some patients who receive long-term maintenance or even palliative chemotherapy have stable disease beyond the time that the tumor would have been expected to develop drug resistance. Patients with slow-growing cancers who are on 'antiangiogenic scheduling' of chemotherapy involving continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil [37-39], weekly paclitaxel [40,41], or daily oral etoposide [42-44], have shown an improved outcome--despite the fact that in some of these patients the tumors had already become drug resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic chemotherapy has also been called 'metronomic' therapy [45], but the two terms do not have precisely the same meaning. 'Antiangiogenic chemotherapy' signifies that the target of the chemotherapy is microvascular endothelium in the tumor b...",

Here we analyse tumours initiated by an endogenous oncogene, ras, and show that senescent cells exist in premalignant tumours but not in malignant ones. Senescence is therefore a defining feature of premalignant tumours that could prove valuable in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.  We used a mouse model for cancer initiation in humans: the animals have a conditional oncogenic K-rasV12 allele that is activated only by the enzyme Cre recombinase3, causing them to develop multiple lung adenomas (premalignant tumours) and a few lung adenocarcinomas (malignant tumours). Senescence markers previously identified in cultured cells were used to detect oncogene-induced senescence in lung sections from control mice (expressing Cre) and from K-rasV12-expressing mice (expressing Cre and activated K-rasV12). We analysed p16INK4a, an effector of in vitro oncogene-induced senescence1, and de novo markers that we identified by using DNA microarray analysis of in vitro oncogene-induced senescence (see supplementary information). These de novo markers are p15INK4b (also known as CDKN2B), Dec1 (BHLHB2) and DcR2 (TNFRSF10D). In addition, we looked for two features evident in cultured senescent cells, namely the expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase4 and the presence of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci5.

Adaptors Adaptors are molecules that are devoid of intrinsic catalytic activity; after binding to the PDGF receptors through their SH2 domains, they connect the receptor with downstream effector molecules. The regulatory subunits of PI 3-kinase and Grb2, which form complexes with the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase and Sos, respectively, are examples of adaptor molecules that have been discussed already. Other adaptor molecules that bind to PDGF receptors are Shc, Grb7, Nck, and Crk.  After binding of Shc to the PDGF receptors, it becomes phosphorylated on Tyr-317, which can be recognized by Grb2/Sos and thus contributes to Ras activation (398), as well as on Tyr-239 and Tyr-240, which initiates another signaling pathway leading to induction of c-myc (148).",

These efforts have resulted in new insights into Rasmediated cell signaling as it relates to human cancer. Ras plays a central role in an intricate array of signal transduction pathways, characterized by cross talk, feedback loops, and multicomponent signaling complexes.1-3 One strategy to overcome the challenges inherent in developing therapeutics against signaling elements situated in redundant pathways is to target elements downstream of convergence points of critical signaling modules. This reasoning has led, in part, to interest in Raf kinase, which is one of several downstream effectors of Ras, as a target for therapeutic development against cancer. The Raf serine/threonine kinases are the principal effectors of Ras in the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Fig 1). Raf activation occurs immediately downstream of membrane and cytoplasmic receptors that relay mitogenic signals.4 Although principally activated by Ras,",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

In the present report, we show that the -92 to -40bp region is essential for the transcription of brca2 in murine mammary cells and that this nucleotide sequence contains one putative CREB/ATF consensus site (cAMP responsive element: CRE). We demonstrated that the mutation of this binding site led to a highly significant reduction of the mouse brca2 transcription, and that CREB, CREM, and/or ATF-1 functionally bound to and regulated this promoter. Therefore, the regulation of the promoter of the mouse brca2 gene is driven by this family of transcription factors.",

Furthermore, we show that the transcription factor, Sp1, represses both the YY1- and the USF2-dependent activation of the Cox5b Inr, indicating competition among Sp1, YY1, and USF2.",

Cells expressing exogenous follistatin (Figure 4A) displayed increased number of nuclei and cell size (Figure 4B) and increased fusion index (Figure 4E). To continue investigating whether follistatin has properties similar to those of TSA, skeletal muscle cells were exposed to recombinant follistatin at different stages of differentiation. As for TSA treatment, follistatin did not increase the size of preformed myotubes (Figures 4C, rFS on myotubes, and 4E). In contrast, myoblasts cultured in the presence of follistatin and prompted to differentiate formed hyper-nucleated myotubes with increased size, due to enhanced fusion (Figures 4D, rFS on myoblasts, and 4E). The effects exerted by TSA on myoblasts are unlikely to be mediated by IL-4 (Figure 2). To evaluate whether follistatin could indirectly activate IL-4 expression, we performed an RT-PCR assay on RNA isolated from C2C12 expressing myc-follistatin and found no signs of IL-4 induction (Figure 4F). Therefore, it appears that the effects exerted by follistatin on muscle cells are similar to those exerted by HDAC inhibitors.  MYOD, CREB, AND NFAT MEDIATE THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATION OF THE FOLLISTATIN PROMOTER INDUCED BY TSA To investigate the effects of TSA on follistatin transcription, the follistatin promoter linked to luciferase (FS-luc) was transfected in skeletal myoblasts. TSA activated transcription of FS-luc (Figure 5A). Within the follistatin proximal promoter, there are an E box, a CRE element, and a consensus site for NFAT (Figure 5B). To ascertain whether MyoD, CREB, and NFAT could activate FS-luc, we transfected murine fibroblasts with the FS-luc reporter and expression vectors for MyoD, a form of constitutively active CREB (CREB Y134F) (Du et al., 2000) and NFATc2. Either MyoD or CREBY134F activated FS-luc transcription (Figure 5C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) and their cotransfection had an additive effect (Figure 5C, lane 4).",

CT105 at nanomolar concentrations strongly activated multiple signaling pathways involving tyrosine kinase-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Moreover, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signal was required for excess TNF-alpha production in human macrophages derived from THP-1 cells. Interferon-gamma significantly potentiated the induction of the CT105-mediated signal cascade. These multiple signaling pathways in turn converged, at least in part, at the nuclear transcription factor known as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which acts on the TNF-alpha gene promoter through the cAMP response element. The cell-permeable cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP partially and almost simultaneously suppressed all of these CT105-induced signaling pathways through excessive CREB phosphorylation, which led to decreased CREB DNA binding activity and reduced TNF-alpha expression. Furthermore, dibutyryl cAMP decreased the interaction of the p65 nuclear factor-kappa B with CREB binding protein, thus further inhibiting CT105-mediated TNF-alpha expression. Collectively, the detailed molecular mechanisms of amyloidogenic CT-induced TNF-alpha production as negatively regulated by cAMP may advance the possibility of targeted treatment in Alzheimer's disease.",

Furthermore, mutation of CRE abolishes SREBP-dependent activation after overexpression of SREBP-1a and CRE binding protein (CREB). This shows that CRE is essential, and that under ex vivo conditions CREB and SREBP cooperate in transactivating CYP51. Interestingly, protein kinase A shows a marked stimulation of the CYP51 promoter activity when overexpressed together with SREBP-1a but not when overexpressed with CREB, suggesting phosphorylation of SREBP-1a. Using a DNA probe containing all three regulatory elements, it is found that SREBP-1a, a CREB-like factor, and specificity protein (Sp1) all probably bind the CYP51 promoter. While SREBP-1a and the CRE-bound proteins are essential for the SREBP-dependent response, Sp1 apparently functions only to maximize sterol regulation of CYP51.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Sirt1 is a deacetylase that attenuates p53 in the presence of oxidative stress; rictor is a rapamycin-insensitive member of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex; and VEGF is likely the major angiogenic factor in melanoma. Inhibition of Akt led to significant and reproducible decreases in the mRNA levels of all 3 genes.  .... Note: if they didnt not use an inhibitor to verify AKT action, I coded to expression of AKT.  If they used an inhibitor to verify action,  coded to kaof (AKT)",

This results in inhibition of Akt activation (pAkt), which may be involved in the growth inhibitory responses seen with PPAR? activation. Decreased Akt activity also can lead to decreased activity of the transcription factor NF-?B. NF-?B is a critical transcription factor in the production of proangiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, IL-8. Decreased production of these factors would be expected to inhibit recruitment of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, and block tumor angiogenesis. PPAR?-mediated suppression of members of the Snail family of transcription factors, such as Snail, Zeb, or Twist, would lead to derepression of E-cadherin expression and promote the epithelial phenotype, leading to decreased migration and invasiveness. PPAR?-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression in NSCLC has been shown by several investigators. This would result in decreased PGE2 production, which will impact growth.

Because FAK binds PI 3-kinase, the protective effect against anoikis may be the result of PI 3-kinase-mediated activation of protein kinase B/Akt (52). Akt promotes survival, at least in part, by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating two proapoptotic proteins, Bad and caspase-9 (53) (Fig. 4). Inhibition of p53 prevents FAKdeficient cells from undergoing anoikis when deprived of growth factors, suggesting that p53 mediates the death signal under FAK deficiency (51).",

This leads to the autophosphorylation of Kit on tyrosine and its association with substrates of various kinds. The phophatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt system is one of the major pathways [33] (fig. 1). PI3K is composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. The 85-kDa regulatory subunit is associated with activated Kit through an SH2 domain, and then is phosphorylated on tyrosine. The 110-kDa catalytic subunit of the activated PI3K produces phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, which in turn is used for phosphorylation of Akt, a serine-threonine kinase. The activated Akt is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis of cells whose survival depends on Kit signaling. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate blocks not only autophosphorylation of Kit but also phosphorylation of Akt [34]. Induction of apoptosis in Kit signaling-dependent cells by imatinib mesylate may be mediated through the inhibition of Akt activity.",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Transient transfection of Rheb1 or Rheb2 in HEK293 cells results in the increase of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) 25,30-33. Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

For example, integrin- airlinked kinase (ILK) activation is inhibited by blockade of Akt function (Persad et al., 2000), and PTEN interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and influences cell migration (Tamura et al., 1999). These interactions affect cell survival, an event influenced by both VEGF and integrins. Also, cell migration and angiogenesis are reg- ulated by Akt and PTEN, and these cellular responses are clearly mediated by integrins (Jiang et al., 2000). By overexpression approaches, we have directly impli- cated Akt and PTEN in the pathway from VEGF to integ- rin activation. Thus, some of the functions of PI 3-kinase, Akt, and PTEN in cell migration may depend upon their role in integrin activation, and engagement of VEGFR2",

              "summary_text": "Interestingly, the presence of two additional basic amino acids 6 and 7 residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation site in certain peptide substrates allows phosphorylation by CaMKI/IV equally well with or without activation by a CaMKK (14). This \\\"activation independence\\\" has not yet been demonstrated toward protein substrates. Nonetheless, because CaMKI/IV requires Ca2+/CaM for deinhibition in addition to activation loop phosphorylation, substrates of this type would not be phosphorylated by CaMKI/IV until a Ca2+ signal was initiated and so could represent Ca2+-dependent but activation-independent signaling targets. Subsequent activation by a CaMKK would increase the number of available substrates by enhancing CaMKI/IV activity toward a second set of substrates (Fig. 1).   Does the Cascade Function in Cells? TOP INTRODUCTION Identification and Biochemical... Does the Cascade Function... Is the Cascade Physiologic? Other Transcriptional Targets... Evidence for a CaMK... REFERENCES  The first reconstruction of a CaMK cascade in cells used transient transfection experiments with CREB as the transcriptional target. CaMKI and CaMKIV phosphorylate CREB on its activating Ser-133 in vitro and stimulate Gal4-CREB-dependent transcription in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ when cells are cotransfected with Gal4-CREB and a Gal4 reporter gene (15). Additional cotransfection with a CaMKK increases reporter activity more than 10-fold (8, 9). Mutation of the CaMKIV activation loop T to A abolishes CaMKK enhancement.  To be a signaling cascade, kinase activation loop phosphorylation must be dependent upon induction of CaMKK activity. Phosphate incorporation into endogenous CaMKIV in Jurkat cells is induced rapidly following T-cell receptor stimulation and is blocked by chelation of extracellular Ca2+. This is accompanied by 8-14-fold increases in immunoprecipitated CaMKIV activity that is refractory to further activation by exogenous CaMKK and can be reversed by in vitro treatment with PP2A (16). Recombinant CaMKIV transfected into BJAB cells, which lack endogenous CaMKIV, demonstrates similar activation following anti-IgM stimulation that is abrogated by mutating the activation loop T to A (4). Likewise, CaMKI phosphorylation is induced in PC12 cells, coincident with increased CaMKI activity and reduced activation of CaMKI by exogenous CaMKK (17). Collectively, these experiments provide strong evidence for an inducible, Ca2+-dependent activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV in intact cells via activation loop phosphorylation. However, the fact that activation loop phosphorylation requires Ca2+ does not confirm that the physiologic activator is itself Ca2+-dependent, because Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKI or CaMKIV is required before these enzymes can be phosphorylated by the known CaMKKs.  The issue of subcellular localization is a confounding one for any model of the CaMK cascade regulating transcription. There are several lines of evidence that CaMKK and - are both cytoplasmic. In contrast to an early study using a polyclonal antibody, immunohistochemistry of rat brain slices using monoclonal antibodies able to distinguish between the  and  isoforms found exclusively cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for both (18). Furthermore, green fluorescent protein-tagged CaMKK and - are cytoplasmic in NG108 cells even after depolarizing stimulation (18). This holds true for overexpressed CaMKK in Jurkat and BJAB cells.2 Similarly, CaMKI appears to be excluded from the nucleus in brain slices as well as in cells overexpressing the protein, yet CaMKI immunoreactivity has recently been observed to translocate to the nuclei of hippocampal neurons during long term potentiation (19, 20).3 In contrast, CaMKIV is predominantly nuclear but can also be found in neuronal soma and dendritic processes, where it could interact with a cytoplasmic CaMKK (21).  The CaMK cascade then is well positioned to affect cytoplasmic e...",

Rho-family GTPases including Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA play central roles in controlling actin cytoskeletal dynamics (Hall, 1998Go). The activities of these proteins are tightly controlled during cell adhesion to the ECM (Hynes, 2002Go; Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002Go). For example, Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion and, via specific effectors, stimulate the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex leading to actin polymerisation and lamellipodia and filopodia formation at the leading edge of cells",

We have identified the two components of the stimulatory heterodimer by amino acid sequencing as a Rho GTPase and the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor LyGDI. Using recombinant Rho GTPases and LyGDI, we demonstrate that PLCbeta2 is stimulated by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[S])-activated Cdc42HsxLyGDI, but not by RhoAxLyGDI. Stimulation of PLCbeta2, which was also observed for GTP[S]-activated recombinant Rac1, was independent of LyGDI, but required C-terminal processing of Cdc42Hs/Rac1. Cdc42Hs/Rac1 also stimulated PLCbeta2 in a system made up of purified recombinant proteins, suggesting that this function is mediated by direct protein-protein interaction.",

This effect appeared not to arise through the hyperactivation of Ras, nor was it a consequence of CAPRI functioning as a Cdc42/Rac GEF, rather the authors show that CAPRI, via its Ras-GAP domain, can bind Rac and Cdc42 directly and act as a scaffold for presenting these GTPases to an unidentified GEF.

The results revealed that CXCL12-promoted migration of DN Rac or Vav1 SH3-SH2-SH3 transfectants was substantially lower than that displayed by transfectants expressing wt Rac, Vav1, or Cdc42, or DN Cdc42 (Figure 8Figure 8.). This migration was inhibited by anti-CXCR4 mAb (unpublished data), and by anti-?4 (Figure 8Figure 8.), indicating that was mediated by ?4?1. Together, these data indicate that activation of Rac and Vav1 by CXCL12 is a key signaling event that leads to efficient up-regulation of ?4?1-dependent T-cell adhesion and transendothelial migration.",

A recent report suggests that Rho/Rho kinase and MLCK may differentially regulate MLC phosphorylation according to spatial localization within cultured cells (144). Additional complexity in the system is provided by the contribution of the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family, downstream effectors of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42. Isoforms PAK1 and PAK2 have both been shown to phosphorylate smooth muscle MLCK and decrease MLCK activity in cultured cells (61, 123), but whether PAK regulates the high-molecular-mass MLCK present in endothelium in this fashion is not clear. Conversely, PAK2 can directly phosphorylate MLC to produce EC contraction (163).",

GEFs activate small GTP-binding proteins such as Ras, Rac-1, and Cdc42 by promoting the conversion of the GDPbound inactive state to the GTP-bound active state, leading to the activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. Activation of the p38 MAPK cascade in Jurkat T cells has been shown to require phosphorylation of the GEF Vav by Zap-70 and subsequent activation of Rac-1. CD28 co-stimulation augments the recruitment of Vav to LAT and Zap-70 and increases Zap-70 mediated Vav phosphorylation [23]. Rac-1 elicits the p38 MAPK cascade through the p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1),",

Like vacuole formation, both of these latter processes are dependent on actin and microtubules (Greenberg, 1995; Davis and Camarillo, 1996; Cardelli, 2001). In addition, the inner surfaces of the pinocytosed membranes contain F-actin (Greenberg, 1995; Davis and Camarillo, 1996; Cardelli, 2001) (Fig. 11). Recent work has elucidated some of the molecular components involved in the cytoskeletal signaling pathways regulating macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. In both cases, Rho GTPases regulate these events. Rac and Cdc42 GTPases have been found to be required for macropinocytosis (Cardelli, 2001; Ridley, 2001a) and Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis (Caron and Hall, 1998). Dominant negative Rac1 and Cdc42 markedly blocked EC vacuole and lumen formation in collagen and fibrin matrices, while dominant negative RhoA had no effect.",

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

Recently, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been shown to be implicated in the cellular response to activated ras. Purified MAP kinases specifically phosphorylated Thr-235 of NF-IL6 in vitro. Mutation of Thr-235 abolished the ras-dependent activation of NF-IL6.

              "summary_text": "Also, antioxidants decrease the mRNA abundance of MSR-1 by suppressing NF-kB and decreasing MSR-1 mRNA stability rather than through direct effects on transcription [102]. A summary of redox effects on various transcription factors as well as on some elements of signal transduction pathways is presented in Table 1. Although Table 1 presents an overview of the effects as well as the differences that may occur between different cell models, a comprehensive presentation of all redox effects on these factors and their interactions is far beyond the scope of the present discussion. For more detailed discussions of some of the effects listed in Table 1, the reader is referred to several excellent reviews [14-17,93,103-105]. Also, we have primarily focused on oxygen-centered species rather than on reactive nitrogen species; for a review of nitrogen intermediates in signal transduction, the reader is referred to the article by Lander [90]. SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS Although many pathways are known to be redoxsensitive, none have been more thoroughly examined than the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways. Many of the redox effects on cells are mediated either directly or indirectly through these pathways, which contain multiple steps sensitive to ROS. Because of the large number of studies of oxidants on the various components of the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways, we provide a brief overview of both these pathways. MAP kinases Extracellular signaling molecules such as growth factors and cytokines induce changes in cell behavior via complex mechanisms that involve transmission of the signal from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, where gene expression is altered [303,304]. The first step of a signaling cascade usually involves the activation of receptors that either have protein kinase activity or activate protein kinases in the cytoplasm. The signal is eventually transmitted to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription factors that regulate gene expression. One of the most studied families of signal transduction pathways is the (MAP) kinase family (Fig. 1). Four MAP kinase subfamilies have been identified to date: (i) ERK [305- 309], (ii) JNK/SAP kinase [310-314], (iii) p38 kinases, [315-318], and (iv) big MAP kinase (BMK/ERK5) [319, 320]. All these pathways contain redox-sensitive sites (Table 1). In the ERK and JNK pathways, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor such as the mammalian homologue of Sos [321] activates Ras by conversion of Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP [322-324]. Sos must usually complex with other proteins to perform this function. It contains SH2 domains, which are a conserved sequence of 100 amino acids that bind to tyrosine phosphorylated motifs in other proteins [17]. In the cytoplasm, Sos is constitutively bound to another SH2 domain-containing protein, Grb-2 [325-327]. Activation of growth factor receptors results in tyrosine autophosphorylation and recruitment of SH2 domain-containing affectors, including Grb-2 [325,328-330]. The result is plasma membrane targeting of Sos [331], where it is tyrosinephosphorylated [332] (Fig. 1). The phosphorylated Grb-2/Sos complex binds to an adapter protein, the SH-containing (SHC) protein [330, 333-336], and the multiprotein complex activates Ras-GDP by converting it to its GTP-bound form [337]. Interestingly, treatment of cells with oxidants such as H2O2 stimulates formation of the SHC-Grb2-Sos complex [99].",

We and others have previously demonstrated that Ras activates the inherent transcriptional activation function of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Supportive of the importance of NF-kappaB in transformation, Ras-induced cellular transformation can be suppressed by expression of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or by dominant-negative forms of the upstream activator IkappaB kinase (IKK). However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.",

Hs766T cells express activated KRAS and display elevated levels of pERK1/2 and pAKT (Fig. 4C). Treatment of Hs766T cells with the PI3'-kinase inhibitor LY294002 led to a selective decrease in pAKT with little or no effect on pERK1/2. By contrast, treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or CI-1040 led to a selective decrease in pERK1/2 with little or no effect on pAKT. Strikingly, both the PI3'-kinase and the MEK inhibitors led to accumulation of p27Kip1 expression. These data are consistent with the observation that both MEK and PI3'-kinase inhibitors elicited a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in Hs766T cells (data not shown). Further consistent with these observations, treatment of a panel of pancreatic cancer cells (eight cell lines) (57) with a MEK inhibitor (U0126 or CI-1040) led to a consistent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest accompanied by induced expression of p27Kip1 in all eight cell lines tested (S. Gysin and M. McMahon, sub- mitted for publication). For the most part, treatment of cells with MEK inhibitors led to a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic effect, although cell death was often observed after prolonged treatment (+6 days). Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with LY294002 led in some cases to a cytostatic effect and in others to a more rapid cytotoxic effect. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 4C, inhibition of PI3'-kinase by LY294002 led to elevated p27Kip1 expression in five of eight pancreas cancer cell lines tested. These data are fully consistent with the hypothesis that the RAS-activated RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3'-kinase- PDK-AKT pathways play a role in the regulation of p27Kip1 expression in bona fide human cancer cell lines.",

This promotes the interaction of Ras with Raf serinethreonine kinase and then the activation of MEK (a MAP kinase kinase). MEK phosphorylates ERK (a MAP kinase), and ERK phosphorylates a number of substrates, including pp90rsk [33]. Imatinib mesylate also inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK [34]. This process is considered to be due to blocking of the Kit signaling by this drug. Thus, both major signaling pathways of Kit, the PI3K/Akt system and the Ras/MAP kinase cascade, are inhibited by imatinib mesylate.",

TGF-B is able to increase the production of mitogenic growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor,51 fibroblast growth factor,52 TGF-B,53 and connective tissue growth factor,54 and to increase expression of the platelet derived growth factor receptor,55 and the epithelial growth factor receptor.56 In addition, TGF-B can activate Smad independent pathways, including the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway,20-22,57,58 which often mediates the proliferative signal of growth factors. Indeed, it is in conjunction with oncogenic forms of Ras (Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras), that TGF-B drives Smad-independent proliferation of human colon and prostate cancer cells.3,49",

Constitutive activation of Raf and Ras are indistinguishable in their potential to induce malignant transformation.6-8 Activating raf mutations have been identified in melanoma, thyroid, colon, and other cancers (Table 1).9-43 Furthermore, the disappointing clinical results of farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitors (FTIs) that were developed based on a flawed premise that they would effectively target malignancies with a high incidence of Ras mutation has led to scrutiny of signaling elements downstream of Ras, such as Raf, as therapeutic targets.44 This review highlights relevant information about the biology of Raf and novel strategies directed at exploiting this knowledge to more effectively treat malignant diseases. SIGNALING THROUGH THE MAPK PATHWAY The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival are receiving considerable attention as potential targets for anticancer strategies. 45,46 Recently, there has been a notable increase in efforts directed at targeting the MAPK pathway, which integrates a wide array of proliferative signals initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein- coupled receptors.47,48 The network of signals emanating from the MAPK pathway are transmitted by proteins that serve as chemical switches, cycling between phosphorylated (activated) and dephosphorylated (inactivated) states.49 These on and off switches are regulated by kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Activated signaling elements, in turn, phosphorylate amino acid residues on downstream signaling proteins in a cascade-like and expansive manner.50 Not only does the centrality of the MAPK pathway render its components important targets for therapeutic development, but many genes that encode for its critical signaling elements undergo mutations, constitutively activating downstream signaling elements and conferring the potential for transformation and autonomous growth.50-52 In addition to efforts directed at Ras, therapeutic strategies directed at the MAPK pathway are targeting the cascade of downstream effector proteins including Raf, MAPK kinase (MAPKK; also called MEK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK] kinase), and ERK. The Raf/MEK/ERK module (Fig 1) of the MAPK pathway, which is immediately downstream of Ras, may be less redundant and innately resistant to therapeutic manipulations compared with Ras (as discussed in the next section). The Unfilled Promise of Targeting Ras The Raf/MEK/ERK module of the MAPK pathway has been the focus of considerable attention because therapeutic efforts directed at Ras, which is situated at the apex of the MAPK pathway, have been disappointing.44 Ras belongs to a superfamily of guanine nucleotide triphosphatases (GTPases) that transmit proliferative and survival signals to the MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and other pathways (Figs 1 and 2). Three ras proto-oncogenes encode four 21-kd proteins, called p21ras or Ras (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B, resulting from two alternatively spliced K-Ras gene products), that are localized to the inner surface of the cell membrane.44 Of the three ras genes, K-ras mutations are most commonly found in solid malignancies, whereas N-ras mutations are encountered less often, and H-ras mutations are rarely encountered.53,54 Ras isoforms impart distinct biologic effects as a result of the potential of these proteins to differentially activitate critical effectors.55 After synthesis as inactive cytosolic propeptides, Ras undergoes a series of post-translational modifications at its carboxyl terminus that increase its hydrophobicity.56,57 These modifications render Ras functional and capable of lo...",

The additive influence of three cis-acting elements is responsible for this regulation in an adrenal carcinoma cell line. Two sites, CRE2 at -48 base pairs (bp) relative to the start of transcription and CRE3 at +95 bp, are identical to the core motif of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) of the somatostatin gene and are conserved in the mouse, rat, and human ODC genes. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in a substantial decrease in basal promoter activity, as well as a 5-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter by PKA. CRE3 did not contribute to the basal activity of the ODC promoter, but mutation of this site resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility by PKA. Deletion of a 45-bp sequence (GC-box) located 5' of CRE2, also resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter. DNase I protection revealed the presence of protein binding at CRE2, the TATA box, and the GC-box of the ODC promoter. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in loss of protection of this sequence, as well as the 3' extension of the footprint over the TATA box, without affecting interactions at the GC box. Antibodies to the well characterized CRE-binding protein CREB recognized proteins binding to CRE2, suggesting that binding of CREB, or an antigenically related protein, is important for the activity of CRE2.

DiFrancesco and Tortora (128) failed to observe a direct regulation of SAN f-channels by purified protein kinase A (PKA) (128). In SAN cells, direct regulation of voltage dependence by cAMP can quantitatively account for If regulation by autonomic agonists (126). The existence of a PKA-mediated regulation of If has been suggested by Chang et al. (80) in canine Purkinje cells and in murine stem cells derived from cardiomyocytes (1). Intracellular Ca2+ have been reported to positively regulate If by either increasing current conductance (171) or by positively shifting the current voltage dependence (416). The mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulate If has not been elucidated. Inside-out patch-clamp experiments seem to exclude a direct Ca2+ effect on f-channels (540).",

The activation of Ras also requires stimulation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, through its interaction with receptor substrates such as Gab-1 or IRS1/2. Activated ERK can translocate into the nucleus, where it catalyses the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as p62TCF, Blockade of the pathway with dominant negative mutants or pharmacological inhibitors prevents the stimulation of cell growth by insulin, but has no effect on the metabolic actions of the hormone54. Insulin increases synthesis and blocks the degradation of proteins through activation of mTOR. The stimulation of this protein kinase involves PI(3)K activation, although another signal may also be required56. mTOR can control the mammalian translation machinery by direct phosphorylation and activation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70rsk)57, as well as phosphorylation of the initiation factor 4E for eukaryotic translation (eIF-4E) inhibitor, PHAS1 or 4E-binding protein 1 (ref. 58). P70rsk activates ribosome biosynthesis by phosphorylating the ribosomal S6 protein, producing increased translation of mRNAs with a 58-terminal oligopyrimidine tract. P70rsk also requires a second PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent phosphorylation, presumably catalysed by PDK1. Phosphorylation of PHAS-1 by mTOR results in its dissociation from eIF-2, allowing capdependent translation of mRNAs with a highly structured 58-untranslated region. Although the mechanism of activation of mTOR remains unclear, it seems to require the presence of amino acids in the media for full activation by growth factors, and thus may also represent a nutrient sensor55. Glucose and lipid regulation Regulation of glycogen synthesis Insulin stimulates glycogen accumulation through a coordinated increase in glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. The hormone activates glycogen synthase by promoting its dephosphorylation, through the inhibition of kinases such as PKA or GSK-3 (ref. 59), and activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)60.",

Luciferase activities induced by PTH were blocked by protein kinase A inhibitor H89 and tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin. The CRE1-protein and CRE2-protein complexes were disrupted by CRE binding protein 1 (CREB1) antibodies and supershifted by phospho-CREB1 antibody. ChIP assays detected binding of CREB1 and phospho-CREB1 to a chromatin fragment containing CRE1 and CRE2, and increased binding of phospho-CREB1 to the both sites.",

High phosphorylation of PLB and RyRs generates periodical LCICR causing INCX-mediated membrane voltage oscillations, which contribute to the control of the chronotropic state of the cell (43, 508). .....Figure 23. In pacemaker cells, high basal cAMP-mediated PKA-dependent phosphorylation stimulates a perpetual \\\"free running\\\" Ca2+ cycling by pumping Ca2+ into the SR via SERCA2 and LCICR via RyRs. PKA also stimulates Ca2+ entry through Cav1.3-mediated ICa,L. The thick red line indicates the persistent spontaneous Ca2+ cycling. The possibility that Cav3.1-mediated ICa,T can contribute to replenishment of SR Ca2+ stores is suggested. Spontaneous LCICR from SR is linked to the diastolic depolarization via Ca2+ activation of inward INCX current. Direct cAMP-dependent activation of HCN channels or cAMP-mediated, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Cav1.3 channels and Ist (dashed lines) strongly stimulates the pacemaker cycle driven by the \\\"membrane ion channels clock\\\" (MCC). It is conceivable that the MCC can entrain the intracellular Ca2+ clock because of the dependency of SR Ca2+ content from VDCCs. (see Fig 23 for detail)",

              "summary_text": "Insulin is the most-potent physiological anabolic agent known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates and lipids and inhibiting their degradation and release into the circulation. This action of the hormone is due in part to the acute regulation of metabolic enzymes through changes in their phosphorylation state. In fat, liver, and muscle, insulin stimulates the dephosphorylation of a number of enzymes involved in glycogen and lipid metabolism via activation of protein phosphatases. Numerous studies have indicated that protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is the primary phosphatase involved in insulin action. Although PP1 is a cytosolic protein, the phosphatase is compartmentalized in cells by discrete targeting subunits. These proteins confer substrate specificity to PP1 and mediate the specific regulation of intracellular pools of PP1 by a variety of extracellular signals. Four proteins have been described that target the phosphatase to the glycogen particle. G(M) and GL are expressed exclusively in striated muscle and liver, while protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) and R6 are more widely expressed. Despite a common targeting function, these four proteins are not highly conserved, suggesting profound differences in the mechanisms by which they contribute to the hormonal regulation of PP1 activity. Overexpression studies in cell lines or animals have revealed major differences among these proteins regarding basal glycogen levels and hormonal responsiveness. Furthermore, alterations in the expression or function of PP1 glycogen-targeting subunits may contribute to the onset of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

Interestingly, protein kinase A shows a marked stimulation of the CYP51 promoter activity when overexpressed together with SREBP-1a but not when overexpressed with CREB, suggesting phosphorylation of SREBP-1a. Using a DNA probe containing all three regulatory elements, it is found that SREBP-1a, a CREB-like factor, and specificity protein (Sp1) all probably bind the CYP51 promoter.
