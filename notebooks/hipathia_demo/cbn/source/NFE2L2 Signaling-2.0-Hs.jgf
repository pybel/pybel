      "boundary_conditions": "The human model sets were built to represent healthy processes and were then enhanced with COPD data to represent early COPD (GOLD stage I and II) processes. If supporting literature from early COPD studies were not available, stage-independent COPD studies were used. For a mechanism predicted from COPD data it was incorporated into a network with an edge based on COPD studies if available, and if not healthy context was used to incorporate these COPD mechanisms. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. We excluded cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, all virus infections, all bacterial infections, septic pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), allergic responses/asthma, pneumoconiosis, and COPD exacerbations. We also excluded animal inhalation studies with solid particles (titanium dioxide, quartz, asbestos, carbon black, diesel exhaust etc). For the in vitro-specific exclusion criteria we excluded tumor-derived cell lines, immortalized cell lines, neuronal cells, and cell types that cannot be found in the respiratory/vascular system. There were some exceptions where we included immortalized cell lines and non-lung cell types for canonical mechanisms where there was evidence that the relationship was not tissue-specific but could also take place in the lung. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available."

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

Taken together, these results delineate a key role for Hck-mediated phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab2 docking proteins in IL-6-induced proliferation and survival of multiple myeloma cells and identify tyrosine kinases and downstream adapter proteins as potential new therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma.",

              "summary_text": "MyD88 also interacts directly with AKT, and a dominant-negative mutant of AKT causes a defect in MyD88-dependent NF-kB transcriptional activity. However, the binding of NF-kB to DNA is not affected by inhibiting AKT, indicating that AKT might be involved in the phosphorylation of the p65 transactivation domain. A dominant-negative mutant of MyD88 was shown to block the kinase activity of AKT generated in response to LPS and IL-1, and a dominant-negative mutant of p85 inhibited the NF-kB activity elicited by LPS and IL-1 but not that elicited by TNF85. These findings indicate that PI3K is a positive mediator of the signalling induced by LPS and IL-1 that leads to NF-kB activation. However, recent studies using mice that lack the p85 regulatory subunit showed an increased production of IL-12 by DCs, possibly because of enhanced activation of the p38 MAPK, indicating that PI3K might have a negative role in TLR signalling in DCs86.  ECSIT. ECSIT has no homology with any known protein and was cloned as a TRAF6-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening87. ECSIT interacts with the conserved TRAF domain of TRAF6. A Drosophila homologue of ECSIT has been identified, and the interaction between TRAF6 and ECSIT is also conserved in Drosophila. ECSIT also interacts with MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase kinase 1), which can phosphorylate and activate the IKK complex. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ECSIT blocks signalling through TLR4, indicating that ECSIT might transduce TLR signals by bridging TRAF6 and the IKK complex. Furthermore, the inhibition of ECSIT expression, using siRNA in a macrophage cell line, resulted in impaired LPS-induced, but not TNF-induced, NF-kB activation88. The physiological function of ECSIT was studied by generating ECSIT-deficient mice, which were found to die on about embryonic day 7.5 (Ref. 88). Further characterization showed that ECSIT is an obligatory intermediate in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, and therefore ECSIT is an essential component in both the TLR- and BMP-signalling pathways.  SRC family of tyrosine kinases. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the SRC-related TEC-family of protein tyrosine kinases and has an essential role in B-cell development and B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signalling. Macrophages from X-linked-immunodeficient mice that lack BTK show reduced responses to LPS, and BTK has also been found to associate with the TIR domain of TLR4,TLR6, TLR8 and TLR9 (Ref. 89). It has also been shown to associate with MyD88, TIRAP and IRAK1, and to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to LPS, whereas a dominant-negative form of BTK inhibits LPS-induced activation of NF-kB, indicating that BTK is involved in the TLR-mediated signalling pathway. During BCR-mediated signalling, BTK interacts with and is activated by the SRC family of tyrosine kinases, such as FYN, LYN and haematopoietic-cell kinase, HCK; however, SRC-family kinases have only a minor role in LPS signalling90. Therefore, the involvement of BTK in TLR signalling needs to be further investigated.  MAPKKK. Members of the MAPKKK family - such as TAK1, MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, TPL2 (tumour-progression locus 2; also known as cancer Osaka thyroid, COT) and NIK - are implicated in IKK-NF-kB and MAPK activation. Among these members, MEKK3 has been shown to be involved in signalling through TLR4 but not through TLR9 (Ref. 91): in response to stimulation with a TLR4 ligand but not a TLR9 ligand, embryonic fibroblasts from MEKK3-deficient mice were shown to have impaired IL-6 production and defective activation of NF-kB, JNK and the p38 MAPK. Stimulation of TLR4 also induced association of MEKK3 with TRAF6. So, MEKK3 is involved in the TLR4-mediated signalling pathway. Another member of the MKKK family, TPL2 has been shown to be involved in the TLR4-mediated activation of ERK92. In response to TLR4 ligand, TPL2-deficient...",

The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31].

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

There has been quite a bit of interest in the MAP kinase family of intracellular protein kinases. As just described, many growth factors that exert their influence through tyrosine kinase receptors inhibit fat cell differentiation. It is now clear that much of this inhibition occurs through activation of the \\\"classic\\\" MAP kinases, Erk 1 and 2. These kinases directly phosphorylate PPARg (see subsequent text), and inhibit its adipogenic activity.33",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185].

The CDFs leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) bind to a LIFR.gp130 receptor complex to activate Jak/signal transducers and activators of transcription and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways. Little is known about how these differentiation factors suppress noradrenergic properties. We used sympathetic neurons and SK-N-BE(2)M17 neuroblastoma cells to investigate CDF down-regulation of the norepinephrine synthetic enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). LIF and CNTF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 but not p38 or Jun N-terminal kinases in both cell types. Preventing ERK activation with PD98059 blocked CNTF suppression of DBH protein in sympathetic neurons but did not prevent the loss of DBH mRNA. CNTF decreased transcription of a DBH promoter-luciferase reporter construct in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and this was also ERK-independent. Cytokine inhibition of DBH promoter activity did not require a silencer element but was prevented by overexpression of the transcriptional activator Phox2a. Inhibiting ERK activation increased basal DBH transcription in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and DBH mRNA in sympathetic neurons. Transfection of Phox2a into PD98059-treated M17 cells resulted in a synergistic increase in DBH promoter activity compared with Phox2a or PD98059 alone. These data suggest that CDFs down-regulate DBH protein via an ERK-dependent pathway but inhibit DBH gene expression through an ERK-independent pathway. They further suggest that ERK activity inhibits basal DBH gene expression.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Recently, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been shown to be implicated in the cellular response to activated ras. Purified MAP kinases specifically phosphorylated Thr-235 of NF-IL6 in vitro. Mutation of Thr-235 abolished the ras-dependent activation of NF-IL6.

              "summary_text": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a central pathway that transmits signals from many extracellular agents to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle progression. The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Understanding of these processes may provide a full picture of the distinct, and even opposing cellular processes that are regulated by the ERK cascade.",

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

In contrast, PMA caused ample GHBP generation from TACE reconstituted (Null/R + T) cells, and this GHBP shedding was substantially inhibited by IC3 pretreatment.

We compared the in vitro phosphorylation of purified IP(3)R1 and IP(3)R3 by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase C (PKC). Phosphorylation of IP(3)R1 by PKC was about eight times stronger than that of IP(3)R3 under identical conditions. Protein kinase A strongly stimulated the PKC-induced phosphorylation of IP(3)R1. In contrast, Ca(2+) inhibited its phosphorylation (IC(50)<or=2microM) and this inhibition was further potentiated by calmodulin (CaM), while the Ca(2+)-independent CaM mutant CaM(1234) was ineffective. Ca(2+) and CaM, however, did not inhibit IP(3)R3 phosphorylation by PKC. Taken together, these findings show that Ca(2+) and CaM differentially regulate the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of IP(3)R1 and IP(3)R3 and are indicative for a role for the inhibition of IP(3)R1 phosphorylation by Ca(2+) and CaM in the negative slope of the bell-shaped effect of Ca(2+) on IP(3)R function.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Astrocytes in the central nervous system are involved in a variety of functions including storage of glycogen, maintenance of the extracellular ionic equilibrium, and support for the migration and the differentiation of neurons. Astrocytes express membrane receptors allowing them to respond to extracellular signals. Activation of receptors induces a cascade of events, such as stimulation of protein kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of target proteins. To understand the regulatory processes underlying neuroglial interactions, attempts were made to identify major phosphorylated proteins in striatal astrocytes, grown in primary culture and labeled with [32P]phosphate. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed a major doublet, Pa and Pb, of highly labeled spots, with a low molecular weight (M(r) = 15,000) and acidic pI (pI = 5.2 and 5.3, respectively). Using an enriched, heat-stable, cytosolic fraction, Pa and Pb were eluted from semi-preparative two-dimensional gels and subjected to a limited proteolysis and partial microsequencing. The same sequences were obtained within Pa and Pb and had no homology with other known protein. Antibodies raised against corresponding synthetic peptides confirm that the doublet represents two isoelectric variants of the same protein, which also exists under a nonphosphorylated form, N. We propose to name this protein PEA-15, for Phosphoprotein Enriched in Astrocytes-15 kDa, according to its large enrichment in these cells. Treatment of intact astrocytes with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which stimulates protein kinase C (PKC), increased the phosphorylation of the more acidic spot (Pb) while decreasing Pa intensity. Stimulations of astrocytes known to increase PKC activity, i.e. noradrenaline, or its inhibition by decreasing extracellular calcium concentrations, staurosporine, or desensitization following long term treatment with TPA, induced a phosphorylation or a dephosphorylation of PEA-15, respectively. Using purified PKC, PEA-15 appeared to be a good substrate in vitro. Two-dimensional peptide mapping revealed that the phosphorylation site in intact cells was identical with the site phosphorylated by PKC in vitro. Mapping the phosphopeptides by HPLC following endolysine C treatment lead to the identification of a sequence, phosphorylated in intact astrocytes and in vitro by PKC, containing a consensus site for PKC: LTRIPSAKK. Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide derived from this sequence recognized N and Pa in control conditions and Pb after its dephosphorylation. Thus, PEA-15 is an endogenous substrate for PKC, the kinase mediating the transition from Pa to Pb.",

Transactivation/phosphorylation of EGFR by E2 was dependent on the rapid liberation of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) from cultured MCF-7 cells and was blocked by antibodies to this ligand for EGFR. Expression of dominant negative mini-genes for Galpha(q) and Galpha(i) blocked E2-induced, EGFR-dependent ERK activation, and Gbetagamma also contributed. G protein activation led to activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9. This resulted from Src-induced MMP activation, implicated using PP2 (Src family kinase inhibitor) or the expression of a dominant negative Src protein.",

Staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) that was initially isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces. Cell cycle arrest was observed upon staurosporine treatment in both normal and transformed cells. Staurosporine induced G1 cell cycle arrest at low nanomolar concentrations, and cellular apoptosis was observed at higher concentrations. The 7-hydroxy analogue of staurosporine, UCN-01, was subsequently identified as a more potent and selective inhibitor of PKC. In several cell lines, UCN-01 inhibited cellular growth and induced apoptosis, correlating with the activation of CDK1 and CDK2. The observation that GF10923X, an even more selective PKC antagonist than UCN-01, inhibited PKC activity but did not inhibit growth, suggested that the CDK activation by UCN-01 may have contributed to its cellular apoptotic effects. Interestingly, UCN-01 inhibits CDC2 and CDK2 in vitro, and it activates these same enzymes in intact cells (reviewed in [64]).",

We reported previously that the hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein, known to be a causative agent in the formation of HCC, activates insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) expression through Sp1 phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In this report we demonstrate that the PTEN effect on HBx induced IGF-II activation in a hepatoma cell line. Expression of PTEN and IGF-II was inversely related in different hepatoma cell lines. PTEN expression induced decreased Sp1 DNA binding by dephosphorylating Sp1 and interfered with transcriptional transactivation of IGF-II by HBx in hepatoma cells. The protein phosphatase activity was involved in PTEN downregulation of IGF-II transcription through downregulation of MAPK, MAPK kinase phosphorylation and PKC translocation. Our data suggest that PTEN blocks Sp1 phosphorylation in response to HBx, by inactivating PKC, MAPK and MAPK kinase which eventually downregulate IGF-II expression, during the formation of HCC.",

Conversely, preincubation of the cells with protein kinase C inhibitors suppressed mechanical stretch-induced PAF receptor gene expression at the mRNA levels and abrogated upstream events of NF-kappaB activation in the cytoplasm. These data strongly suggest that stretch-induced PAF receptor gene expression is mediated by NF-kappaB binding to the PAF receptor gene promoter and that protein kinase C activation is among the molecular features of NF-kappaB activation and translocation into the nucleus in mechanically stretched cells.",

              "summary_text": "Mast cells are the major effector cell type in IgE-mediated immediate hypersensitivity. Traditionally, it is thought that mast cells bound to Ag-specific Fc?RI, so-called sensitized mast cells, encounter multivalent Ag, and then IgE-bound receptors are aggregated or cross-linked, leading to cell activation (1). Activated mast cells secrete preformed and newly synthesized proinflammatory mediators involved in inflammatory processes of allergy, such as histamine, proteases, lipids, cytokines, and chemokines. The mouse Fc?RI consists of an IgE-binding ? subunit, a signal-amplifying {beta} subunit, and disulfide-bonded two molecules of signal-generating ? subunit (2). Fc?RI aggregation leads to the activation of {beta} subunit-bound Lyn, a prominent Src family protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK)3 in mast cells (3). Lyn phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in the ITAMs of the {beta} and ? subunits (4). Phosphorylated ITAMs of {beta} and ? subunits, respectively, recruit Lyn and Syk, a member of another PTK family with two tandemly arranged Src homology 2 domains, leading to the activation of these PTKs. Active Lyn and Syk phosphorylate numerous cellular target proteins, leading to the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K and phospholipase C (PLC)-?. An alternative pathway involving Fyn (another Src family PTK) was shown to activate PI3K (5). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two second messengers, i.e., diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and then Ca2+ influx. Increased DAG and Ca2+ lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (reviewed in Ref. 6). Both PKC and Ca2+ are required for optimal degranulation (7). ",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Two parameters, the AvDiff and the absolute call (present or absent), extracted from the Affymetrix data files, were used in the data analysis, which was performed using GenespringTM (Silicon Genetics, CA). Results were sorted using a combination of high and low stringency filtering criteria. High stringency filtering required that a gene should have an absolute call of present in six of six samples with a mean -fold change of ?±1.6. Low stringency filtering required that the gene be called present in two of the three replicates in the more highly expressing group with a mean AvDiff of ?750 and mean -fold change of ?2. Mean -fold changes between groups were calculated from the mean AvDiffs. Data passing these criteria were combined and subjected to statistical analysis.",

SCF also induces the AKT- and MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of Bim in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and it has been proposed that this also leads to its proteosomal degradation [76].

Short-term activation (2 wk) of Akt1 resulted in completely reversible hypertrophy with maintained contractility. In contrast, chronic Akt1 activation (6 wk) induced extensive cardiac hypertrophy, severe contractile dysfunction, and massive interstitial fibrosis. The focus of this study was to create a transcript expression profile of the heart as it undergoes reversible Akt1-mediated hypertrophy and during the transition from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure. Heart tissue was analyzed before transgene induction, 2 wk after transgene induction, 2 wk of transgene induction followed by 2 days of repression, 6 wk after transgene induction, and 6 wk of transgene induction followed by 2 wk of repression. Acute overexpression of Akt1 (2 wk) leads to changes in the expression of 826 transcripts relative to noninduced hearts, whereas chronic induction (6 wk) led to changes in the expression of 1,611, of which 65% represented transcripts that were regulated during the pathological phase of heart growth. Another set of genes identified was uniquely regulated during heart regression but not growth, indicating that nonoverlapping transcription programs participate in the processes of cardiac hypertrophy and atrophy. These data define the gene regulatory programs downstream of Akt that control heart size and contribute to the transition from compensatory hypertrophy to heart failure.",

Here we tested the hypertrophic effects of these peptides. We examined the effects of the peptides on cell area, protein synthesis, and induction of the natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP. All three peptides were able to increase all the markers of hypertrophy examined, with SCP being the most potent of the three, followed by UCN and SRP last. In addition, we provide a mechanism of action for the three peptides and show that Akt phosphorylation is important for their hypertrophic action, whereas MAPK p42/44 is not involved in this effect.

Upon growth factor stimulation, Akt is activated, directly phosphorylating FKHRL1 at T32 and S253, and to a lesser extent at S315, and resulting in FKHRL1 relocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ....  Similar AKT-dependent changes in subcellular localization have also been observed for the additional FKHRL1 human homologs AFX and FKHR.... Phosphorylation at T32 and S253 causes FKHRL1 to bind to 14-3-3, suggesting that the interaction between FKHRL1 and 14-3-3 may play an important role in regulating the subcellular localization of the complex.",

              "summary_text": "Mechanisms of cancer promotion by COX-2 are not fully understood, but signaling through prostaglandin (PG)E2 receptors is a contributing factor. The major PGE2 receptors on epithelial cells, EP2 and EP4, increase cAMP production, which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in some cell types.  To explore the hypothesis that PGE2-stimulated cAMP  is a key intracellular mediator of COX-2-dependent antiapoptosis and define the underlying mechanisms, we used the T84 human colon epithelial cell line, which exhibits inducible apoptosis and is responsive to PGE2  stimulation (31, 34, 35). The major PGE2 receptors on colon epithelial cells are EP2 and EP4  (25), a finding we confirmed by RT-PCR of T84 cells (data not shown). Both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP as a second messenger, suggesting that cAMP mediates antiapoptotic functions in epithelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that a membrane-permeant  cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, and CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs regulatory protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl  cyclase, also inhibited Fas- and staurosporine-promoted apoptosis  (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by evidence that CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP also inhibited the formation of apoptosis-associated DNA laddering in T84 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We obtained similar results with the normal rat intestinal epithelial  cell line, RIE-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antiapoptotic response to increases in cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells is independent of their state of transformation and conserved across at least two species.\\\"From full text\\\"",

It is also expressed in normal tissues of the liver and kidney where it functions to actively transport lipophilic xenobiotics. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis confirmed the results of the microarray, showing increased mRNA levels for MDR1 in Cox-2 overexpressing cells.e again confirm that Cox-2 overexpressing RMC have increased MDR1 expression. We also observed that the addition of NS398 blocked the up-regulation of the MDR1 protein, consistent with the R123 efflux assay showing reduced MDR1 activity.

Two different strains of human lung fibroblasts were pretreated with NS-398 for 1 h before treatment with 1% CSE for 24 h, and supernatants were analyzed for PGE2. As shown in Fig. 2, the fibroblast strains incubated with 1% CSE had a three- to fourfold induction in PGE2 synthesis over basal levels after 24 h, depending on the strain. However, cells treated with both CSE and NS-398 had significantly decreased PGE2 levels relative to fibroblasts treated with CSE alone, supporting the idea that the elevated PGE2 levels are a result of COX-2 activity.

Phosphorylation of eIF2{alpha} inhibits general protein synthesis by reducing the levels of eIF2-GTP that are required for binding of initiator tRNA to the translation apparatus. Concomitant with lowered protein synthesis, eIF2{alpha} phosphorylation leads to preferential translation of ATF4, a basic zipper (bZIP) transcription activator important for directing transcription of stress-related genes (17?20). Reduced protein synthesis conserves energy and provides the cell time for ATF4 and other stress-responsive transcription factors to reconfigure gene expression slated to alleviate damage elicited by the underlying stress. Other members of the eIF2 kinase family include PEK/Perk (EIF2AK3), whose activity is enhanced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (21, 22); HRI (EIF2AK1), which is regulated by heme deficiency and oxidative stress (23); and PKR (EIF2AK2), which functions in an antiviral pathway (24).{P@S52 is the common phosphorylation site between all 4 kinases and confirmed in Uniprot}",

              "summary_text": "FIG. 7. The signaling arms of the mammalian UPR diverge to regulate some targets and converge to regulate others. The mammalian UPR activates three signal transducers, ATF6, Ire1, and PERK. 1) Activation of ATF6 leads to increased expression of genes regulated by ERSEs in their promoters including ER chaperones like BiP and GRP94, as well as the transcription factor XBP-1. Activation of Ire1 leads to alternative XBP-1 splicing, which in turn up-regulates XBP-1 specific targets like ERdj4, as well as targets with ERSEs in their promoter. A PERK-dependent target other than ATF4 can influence the activation of the ERSE site by an unknown mechanism, which is indicated by a question mark in the schematics. 2) PERK activation leads to eIF-2{alpha} phosphorylation, which allows the expression of the ATF4 transcription factor that in turn induces GADD34 transcription. There is no evidence at this time for members of the ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1 pathways to impact on the PERK pathway. 3) Finally, the ATF6, Ire1/XBP-1 and PERK pathways converge to optimally induce targets that include CHOP and Herp. Those targets that are downstream of the PERK branch of the UPR are shared with various other cellular stress conditions like heme deficiency, amino acid deprivation, and dsRNA expression. These stresses all activate an eIF-2{alpha} kinase and as a result induce downstream targets like ATF4 and GADD34, as well as those that are dually regulated by both the shared and the ER stress-specific branches of the UPR, which are represented by CHOP and Herp.

[36] recently investigated TNF-a-induced HIF-1a accumulation and demonstrated that an NFkB-mediated event that is normally associated with inflammation and cell survival caused protein accumulation in normoxic cells. Although the report fails to identify the mechanism of HIF-1a accumulation, it is suggested that this might interfere with the pVHL-mediated HIF-1a degradation process. Further studies support the concept of a pVHL-dependent cytotoxicity to TNF-a in RCC cells [37,38]. In particular, it has been reported that RCC cells can be sensitized to TNF-a-induced cytotoxicity by re-introducing wild-type VHL [38]. The authors highlight the fact that TNFreceptor engagement by TNF-a triggers the activation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), which, through IKKb phosphorylation, liberates NFkB, thereby initiating the transcription of genes that are involved in apoptosis.",

The CLCA1/MAPK13 signaling pathway is initiated when environmental stimuli (e.g., allergen or virus) stimulate IL-13 production and subsequent activation of IL-13 receptor on the surface of mucous precursor cells. IL-13 receptor activation leads to STAT6 activation and consequent induction of CLCA1 gene expression. The CLCA1 protein is secreted as N-terminal and C-terminal CLCA1 (N-CLCA1 and C-CLCA1) peptide fragments that might activate a putative CLCA1 receptor and in turn MAPK13 to drive a consequent increase in mucin (especially MUC5AC) gene expression and mucus production in airway mucous cells.",

However, in mammalians no such protein has been found yet. In yeast, heme signals are mainly mediated by the heme activator protein Hap1, which in response to heme, activates the transcription of genes necessary for respiration and control of oxidative damage (Pfeifer et al., 1987; Lee et al., 2001). Heme repression is achieved through the action of the ROX1 repressor, the expression of which is transcriptionally activated by heme (Zhang and Hach, 1999).  Recently, a mammalian transcription repressor, Bach1, was identified, which is inactivated upon heme binding (Ogawa et al., 2001).",

We found that Nrf2/small Maf heterodimers bind with high affinity to the rat QR ARE but with low affinity to the rat GST A2 ARE.

Exhibiting an (Nrf2-independent) expression profile characteristic for phase 1 genes, which is also supported by a previous promoter analysis (Xie et al., 1996), this gene was found to be constitutively upregulated > 12-fold in lung tissue of unexposed mice exhibiting a Clara cell–specific conditional knock out in the keap1 gene (Jon Maher and Keiko Taguchi, unpublished observation). Thus, we conclude that aldh3a1 is targeted by both the Ah receptor and the Nrf2 pathway, supporting the concept that drug-processing genes may be activated by an AhR-Nrf2 signaling axis (Yeager et al., 2009).",

              "summary_text": "Expression of phase II detoxifying genes is regulated by NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant response element (ARE) activation. We showed previously that phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase plays an essential role in ARE-mediated rGSTA2 induction by oxidative stress. In view of the fact that the signaling pathway of PI3-kinase controls microfilaments and translocation of actin-associated proteins, the current study was designed to investigate the PI3-kinase-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and the interaction of Nrf2 with actin. tert-Butylhydroquinone (t-BHQ) caused Nrf2 to translocate into the nucleus in H4IIE cells, which was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with PI3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin/LY294002). t-BHQ relocalized Nrf2 in concert with changes in actin microfilament architecture, as visualized by superposition of immunochemically stained Nrf2 and fluorescent phalloidin-stained actin. Furthermore, t-BHQ increased the level of nuclear actin, coimmunoprecipitated with Nrf2, which returned to that of control by pretreatment of the cells with PI3-kinase inhibitors. Cytochalasin B, an actin disruptor, alone stimulated actin-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and induced rGSTA2. In contrast, phalloidin, an agent that prevents actin filaments from depolymerization, inhibited Nrf2 translocation and rGSTA2 induction by t-BHQ. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analyses allowed us to detect both 57- and 100-kDa Nrf2. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation assays showed that the 100-kDa protein comprised both Nrf2 and actin. The present study demonstrates that the PI3-kinase signaling pathway regulates rearrangement of actin microfilaments in response to oxidative stress and that depolymerization of actin causes a complex of Nrf2 bound with actin to translocate into nucleus.",

The anti-V5 antibody recognized V5-Keap1 and coimmunoprecipitated Nrf2 (Fig. 4 D, lane 1); the inclusion of Flag-DJ-1 eliminated this coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 D, lane 2). Reverse immunoprecipitation shows that antibody to endogenous Nrf2 coprecipitated V5-Keap1 (Fig. 4 D, lane 4), which was also decreased by Flag-DJ-1 (lane 5).

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a central pathway that transmits signals from many extracellular agents to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle progression. The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Understanding of these processes may provide a full picture of the distinct, and even opposing cellular processes that are regulated by the ERK cascade.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

Although numerous hormones and cytokines have been shown to induce human ASM (HASM) proliferation, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HASM hyperplasia are largely unknown. Here we characterize the roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily [p42/p44 MAPK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), and p38] in mediating hormone- and cytokine-induced HASM proliferation. Significant enhancement of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in HASM cultures was observed only by treatment with agents (epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, thrombin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) that promoted a strong and sustained activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Significant activation of the JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways was only observed on stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, agents that did not appreciably stimulate HASM proliferation. Two different inhibitors of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), PD-98059 and U-0126, inhibited mitogen-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation in a manner consistent with their ability to inhibit p42/p44 activation. Elk-1 and activator protein-1 reporter activation by mitogens was similarly inhibited by inhibition of MEK, suggesting a linkage between p42/p44 activation, transcription factor activation, and HASM proliferation. These findings establish a fundamental role for p42/p44 activation in regulating HASM proliferation and provide insight into species-specific differences observed among studies in ASM mitogenesis.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

              "summary_text": "MyD88 also interacts directly with AKT, and a dominant-negative mutant of AKT causes a defect in MyD88-dependent NF-kB transcriptional activity. However, the binding of NF-kB to DNA is not affected by inhibiting AKT, indicating that AKT might be involved in the phosphorylation of the p65 transactivation domain. A dominant-negative mutant of MyD88 was shown to block the kinase activity of AKT generated in response to LPS and IL-1, and a dominant-negative mutant of p85 inhibited the NF-kB activity elicited by LPS and IL-1 but not that elicited by TNF85. These findings indicate that PI3K is a positive mediator of the signalling induced by LPS and IL-1 that leads to NF-kB activation. However, recent studies using mice that lack the p85 regulatory subunit showed an increased production of IL-12 by DCs, possibly because of enhanced activation of the p38 MAPK, indicating that PI3K might have a negative role in TLR signalling in DCs86.  ECSIT. ECSIT has no homology with any known protein and was cloned as a TRAF6-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening87. ECSIT interacts with the conserved TRAF domain of TRAF6. A Drosophila homologue of ECSIT has been identified, and the interaction between TRAF6 and ECSIT is also conserved in Drosophila. ECSIT also interacts with MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase kinase 1), which can phosphorylate and activate the IKK complex. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ECSIT blocks signalling through TLR4, indicating that ECSIT might transduce TLR signals by bridging TRAF6 and the IKK complex. Furthermore, the inhibition of ECSIT expression, using siRNA in a macrophage cell line, resulted in impaired LPS-induced, but not TNF-induced, NF-kB activation88. The physiological function of ECSIT was studied by generating ECSIT-deficient mice, which were found to die on about embryonic day 7.5 (Ref. 88). Further characterization showed that ECSIT is an obligatory intermediate in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, and therefore ECSIT is an essential component in both the TLR- and BMP-signalling pathways.  SRC family of tyrosine kinases. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the SRC-related TEC-family of protein tyrosine kinases and has an essential role in B-cell development and B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signalling. Macrophages from X-linked-immunodeficient mice that lack BTK show reduced responses to LPS, and BTK has also been found to associate with the TIR domain of TLR4,TLR6, TLR8 and TLR9 (Ref. 89). It has also been shown to associate with MyD88, TIRAP and IRAK1, and to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to LPS, whereas a dominant-negative form of BTK inhibits LPS-induced activation of NF-kB, indicating that BTK is involved in the TLR-mediated signalling pathway. During BCR-mediated signalling, BTK interacts with and is activated by the SRC family of tyrosine kinases, such as FYN, LYN and haematopoietic-cell kinase, HCK; however, SRC-family kinases have only a minor role in LPS signalling90. Therefore, the involvement of BTK in TLR signalling needs to be further investigated.  MAPKKK. Members of the MAPKKK family - such as TAK1, MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, TPL2 (tumour-progression locus 2; also known as cancer Osaka thyroid, COT) and NIK - are implicated in IKK-NF-kB and MAPK activation. Among these members, MEKK3 has been shown to be involved in signalling through TLR4 but not through TLR9 (Ref. 91): in response to stimulation with a TLR4 ligand but not a TLR9 ligand, embryonic fibroblasts from MEKK3-deficient mice were shown to have impaired IL-6 production and defective activation of NF-kB, JNK and the p38 MAPK. Stimulation of TLR4 also induced association of MEKK3 with TRAF6. So, MEKK3 is involved in the TLR4-mediated signalling pathway. Another member of the MKKK family, TPL2 has been shown to be involved in the TLR4-mediated activation of ERK92. In response to TLR4 ligand, TPL2-deficient...",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185].

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Indeed, the a, b, and e subunits of F(1)F(0)- ATPase have PKC consensus motifs [41].

More significantly, PD98059 blocked perforin and granzyme B movement in NK92 cells towards target cells (Fig. 1a,b). These results confirm that ERK1/2 are responsible for the mobilization and redistribution of perforin and granzyme B to effect lysis6.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis.

Moreover, these authors found that mono-phosphorylation of ATF2 Thr69 strongly reduces the phosphorylation rate of Thr71, whereas, in contrast, mono-phosphorylation of Thr71 does not reduce the rate of Thr69 phosphorylation. Thus, efficient phosphorylation of ATF2 by recombinant E.coli-expressed active p38 only occurs in the order Thr71-> Thr69 + 71 (Figure 7). ",

Recent studies suggest that decreased aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is correlated with increased staining of MUC5AC in submucosal glands of COPD patients. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the major insults in airway mucin secretion in COPD. In this study, changes in both AQP5 and MUC5AC expression levels in SPC-A1, a human airway submucosal gland cell line, were quantified after exposure of the cells to LPS. AQP5 transcription and protein expression were decreased while MUC5AC expression was increased by LPS exposure in SPC-A1 cells. Further studies revealed that AQP5 expression was down-regulated via the p38/JNK signaling pathway, while MUC5AC was up-regulated through the EGFR-p38/JNK pathway. Therefore, p38 and JNK may become promising targets to preserve AQP5 expression and prevent MUC5AC over-expression to restore proper H(2)O to mucin ratio of the airway mucus, which may be beneficial to the clinical management of COPD patients.",

In this report we demonstrate that the PTEN effect on HBx induced IGF-II activation in a hepatoma cell line. Expression of PTEN and IGF-II was inversely related in different hepatoma cell lines. PTEN expression induced decreased Sp1 DNA binding by dephosphorylating Sp1 and interfered with transcriptional transactivation of IGF-II by HBx in hepatoma cells. The protein phosphatase activity was involved in PTEN downregulation of IGF-II transcription through downregulation of MAPK, MAPK kinase phosphorylation and PKC translocation. Our data suggest that PTEN blocks Sp1 phosphorylation in response to HBx, by inactivating PKC, MAPK and MAPK kinase which eventually downregulate IGF-II expression, during the formation of HCC.",

Inhibition of foam cell formation by blockade of the p38 pathway is, at least in part, due to inhibition of oxLDL-induced up-regulation of the scavenger receptor CD36. Using pharmaceutical inhibitors and dominant active MAP kinase kinases, we demonstrated that activation of the p38 pathway, but not the ERK or JNK pathways, is necessary and sufficient to transactivate PPARgamma, a nuclear receptor that has recently been shown to play a pivotal role in oxLDL-induced CD36 expression. Our results for the first time demonstrate a regulation of CD36 by p38, and the importance of the p38 pathway in regulation of foam cell formation.",

The activation of Ras also requires stimulation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, through its interaction with receptor substrates such as Gab-1 or IRS1/2. Activated ERK can translocate into the nucleus, where it catalyses the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as p62TCF, Blockade of the pathway with dominant negative mutants or pharmacological inhibitors prevents the stimulation of cell growth by insulin, but has no effect on the metabolic actions of the hormone54. Insulin increases synthesis and blocks the degradation of proteins through activation of mTOR. The stimulation of this protein kinase involves PI(3)K activation, although another signal may also be required56. mTOR can control the mammalian translation machinery by direct phosphorylation and activation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70rsk)57, as well as phosphorylation of the initiation factor 4E for eukaryotic translation (eIF-4E) inhibitor, PHAS1 or 4E-binding protein 1 (ref. 58). P70rsk activates ribosome biosynthesis by phosphorylating the ribosomal S6 protein, producing increased translation of mRNAs with a 58-terminal oligopyrimidine tract. P70rsk also requires a second PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent phosphorylation, presumably catalysed by PDK1. Phosphorylation of PHAS-1 by mTOR results in its dissociation from eIF-2, allowing capdependent translation of mRNAs with a highly structured 58-untranslated region. Although the mechanism of activation of mTOR remains unclear, it seems to require the presence of amino acids in the media for full activation by growth factors, and thus may also represent a nutrient sensor55. Glucose and lipid regulation Regulation of glycogen synthesis Insulin stimulates glycogen accumulation through a coordinated increase in glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. The hormone activates glycogen synthase by promoting its dephosphorylation, through the inhibition of kinases such as PKA or GSK-3 (ref. 59), and activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)60.",

To test this, we transfected NIH-3T3 with N2-IC in the presence of increasing amounts of Wnt1-hFc (26) along with the Hes1-luc reporter. Consistent with our hypothesis, coexpression of Wnt1 with N2-IC resulted in up-regulation of the Hes1 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A), whereas no effect was observed when Wnt1 was expressed in the absence of N2-IC (Fig 7A).",

              "summary_text": "These findings suggest that different signal transduction pathways as well as cell cycle-specific regulation are controlling the phosphorylation of Ser-62. Indeed RAS signaling that results in the activation of MAP kinases has been suggested to enhance MYC phosphorylation at Ser-62 (31, 32). Phosphorylation at this site appears to affect the stability of MYC at the G0 to G1 transition and to regulate MYC DNA binding (see below). Together these findings promote an attractive model because the RAS signaling pathway is activated by many growth factors and coincides with a strong increase in MYC protein levels upon reentry of cells into the cell cycle. However, because the evidence was derived from cells that overexpressed MYC from recombinant adenoviruses (31, 32), some caution is indicated. The massive overexpression of MYC in resting cells should stimulate cell cycle entry and apoptosis. Also it is not clear whether enough MAXis present in cells to build faithful MYC/MAX complexes. These artificial conditions may severely affect protein behavior, including stability and the response to RAS signaling. It should also be considered that MYC mRNA expression is strongly enhanced upon growth factor treatment of resting cells (6), and the analysis of de novo MYC protein synthesis has revealed a substantial increase in different cell types, including primary cells (33, 34). Thus the contribution of RAS signaling to MYC expression levels at the G0 to G1 transition will need further studying. It should also be noted that the role of MAPK in phosphorylating Ser-62 has been disputed (29). Once Ser-62 is phosphorylated, Thr-58 of MYC becomes a substrate for GSK3 (24). Most substrates of this enzyme must first be phosphorylated by another kinase at a Ser or Thr amino acid four residues C-terminal of the GSK3 site (35). This \\\"priming phosphate\\\" binds specifically into a pocket of the substrate recognition domain of GSK3 and explains why MYC and other substrates require this phosphorylation for the precise positioning of the phosphorylation site. Thus phosphorylation of Thr-58 appears to be strictly dependent on prior phosphorylation of Ser-62. Similar findings were made for MYCN (36). Phosphorylation at Ser-54 by CDK1 leads to Thr-50 phosphorylation by GSK3, the two sites correspond to Ser-62 and Thr-58 in MYC, respectively, which enhances MYCN turnover during mitosis in neuronal cells.",

This action of the hormone is due in part to the acute regulation of metabolic enzymes through changes in their phosphorylation state. In fat, liver, and muscle, insulin stimulates the dephosphorylation of a number of enzymes involved in glycogen and lipid metabolism via activation of protein phosphatases. Numerous studies have indicated that protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is the primary phosphatase involved in insulin action. Although PP1 is a cytosolic protein, the phosphatase is compartmentalized in cells by discrete targeting subunits. These proteins confer substrate specificity to PP1 and mediate the specific regulation of intracellular pools of PP1 by a variety of extracellular signals. Four proteins have been described that target the phosphatase to the glycogen particle. G(M) and GL are expressed exclusively in striated muscle and liver, while protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) and R6 are more widely expressed. Despite a common targeting function, these four proteins are not highly conserved, suggesting profound differences in the mechanisms by which they contribute to the hormonal regulation of PP1 activity. Overexpression studies in cell lines or animals have revealed major differences among these proteins regarding basal glycogen levels and hormonal responsiveness. Furthermore, alterations in the expression or function of PP1 glycogen-targeting subunits may contribute to the onset of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

These data indicated that the activation of p38 MAPK by CO is PI3K/Akt-dependent. We next tested whether CO modulated STAT1 and STAT3 via PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. We pretreated PAEC with SB203580 and observed that CO can no longer modulate STAT1 or STAT3 activation (Fig. 2D, lane 5). Consistent with our data that PI3K/Akt activation is upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO during A-R (Fig. 2C), when we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, CO lost its ability to decrease STAT1 and increase STAT3 activation during A-R (Fig. 2D, lane 4). These data demonstrated that the opposing effect of CO on STAT1 and STAT3 activation is dependent upon PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK pathways. ",

The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation.

However, this molecular mechanism of activation is not yet understood. We show here that endogenous TAK1 is constitutively associated with TAB1 and phosphorylated following IL-1 stimulation. Furthermore, TAK1 is constitutively phosphorylated when ectopically overexpressed with TAB1. In both cases, dephosphorylation of TAK1 renders it inactive, but it can be reactivated by preincubation with ATP. A mutant of TAK1 that lacks kinase activity is not phosphorylated either following IL-1 treatment or when coexpressed with TAB1, indicating that TAK1 phosphorylation is due to autophosphorylation. Furthermore, mutation to alanine of a conserved serine residue (Ser-192) in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII abolishes both phosphorylation and activation of TAK1. These results suggest that IL-1 and ectopic expression of TAB1 both activate TAK1 via autophosphorylation of Ser-192.",

A number of signalling pathways can be activated downstream of IRS proteins. Molecules containing Src homology 2 domain, including the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb-2, SHP2 and others, are recruited to the Tyr phosphorylated IRSs and transmit a cascade of signals, which consists in two major elements, i.e. Ras/Raf/p44-p42MAPK and PI3K/ Akt/p70S6K pathways (Virkamaki et al. 1999).

AGF mutation in the phosphorylation site of the kinase.9 This mutant prevents hypoxia-induced activation of endogenous p38alpha MAPK.4 We predicted that inactivating p38alpha MAPK would diminish the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of p53. Accordingly, little p-p53(S15) was observed in the presence of p38alphaDN during H/R, corrected for modest change in total p53 protein concentration (Figure 2). Similarly, the use of a chemical inhibitor of p38alpha MAPK, SB203580 (SB), also attenuated p-p53(S15). Although SB inhibits both p38alpha and p38beta MAPKs, the latter is not activated by H/R stress alone, whereas the former is significantly up-regulated by the same stimulus.4 Therefore, SB is likely to inhibit p38alpha MAPK to a much greater degree than p38beta in H/R. Overall, these results indicate that H/R-induced p53 depends on p38alpha MAPK. ",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

While CD2-induced p62(dok) tyrosine phosphorylation was independent of both the p36/38 membrane adapter protein linker of activated T cells (LAT) and the ZAP70/Syk family of kinases, it was dependent upon the Src family of kinases including Lck and Fyn.

Third, studies in primary cardiac myocytes in culture and in the hearts of transgenic mice have demonstrated that overexpression of PGC-1{alpha} up-regulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, most of which are PPAR{alpha} targets, in addition to NRF-1 targets (Lehman et al. 2000Go). Cardiac-specific overexpression of PGC-1{alpha} in transgenic mice leads to massive mitochondrial proliferation, ultimately resulting in cardiomyopathy and death (Lehman et al. 2000Go). Interestingly, in neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture, PGC-1{alpha} induces mitochondria that support largely coupled respiration consistent with the known ATP-generating function of this organelle in heart (Lehman et al. 2000Go). Lastly, forced expression of PGC-1{alpha} in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice triggers mitochondrial proliferation and the formation of mitochondrial-rich type I, oxidative (\\\"slow-twitch\\\") muscle fibers (Lin et al. 2002bGo). Collectively, these results indicate that PGC-1{alpha} is capable of promoting mitochondrial biogenesis through its coactivating effects on key factors such as NRF-1.",

Phosphorylation by JNK increases the ability of c-Jun to activate AP-1-dependent transcription. To determine whether the sustained JNK activation that occurred in response to TNF and NF-kappaB inhibition resulted in increased c-Jun activation, AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity was measured in untreated and TNF treated cells. RALA hepatocytes were transiently transfected with the AP-1-driven firefly luciferase reporter construct Coll73-Luc, and the constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK for normalization. No significant increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity occurred in Ad5LacZ-infected cells at 4 hours after TNF treatment (Fig. 1B). AP-1 transcriptional activity in Ad5IkappaB-infected cells was increased slightly in untreated cells and almost 3-fold in cells treated with TNF (Fig. 1B). JNK overactivation resulting from NF-kappaB inactivation therefore led to increased AP-1-dependent transcription.",
