              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

These receptors are believed to transduce signals by phosphorylation on Tyr residues of several cellular substrates including insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins 1, 2, 3 and 4 (White 2003). A number of signalling pathways can be activated downstream of IRS proteins. Molecules containing Src homology 2 domain, including the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Grb-2, SHP2 and others, are recruited to the Tyr phosphorylated IRSs and transmit a cascade of signals, which consists in two major elements, i.e. Ras/Raf/p44-p42MAPK and PI3K/ Akt/p70S6K pathways (Virkamaki et al. 1999). More recently, p38MAPK, a parallel MAPK signal transduction pathway that becomes activated in response to cellular stresses (Nebreda & Porras 2000), has been shown to be stimulated by insulin in several cell systems including skeletal muscle (Conejo & Lorenzo 2001).",

AGF mutation in the phosphorylation site of the kinase.9 This mutant prevents hypoxia-induced activation of endogenous p38alpha MAPK.4 We predicted that inactivating p38alpha MAPK would diminish the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of p53. Accordingly, little p-p53(S15) was observed in the presence of p38alphaDN during H/R, corrected for modest change in total p53 protein concentration (Figure 2). Similarly, the use of a chemical inhibitor of p38alpha MAPK, SB203580 (SB), also attenuated p-p53(S15). Although SB inhibits both p38alpha and p38beta MAPKs, the latter is not activated by H/R stress alone, whereas the former is significantly up-regulated by the same stimulus.4 Therefore, SB is likely to inhibit p38alpha MAPK to a much greater degree than p38beta in H/R. Overall, these results indicate that H/R-induced p53 depends on p38alpha MAPK. ",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

MAP kinases lie within protein kinase cascades. Each cascade consists of no fewer than three enzymes that are activated in series. Cascades convey information to effectors, coordinates incoming information from other signaling pathways, amplify signals, and allow for a variety of response patterns. Subcellular localization of enzymes in the cascades is an important aspect of their mechanisms of action and contributes to cell-type and ligand-specific responses.

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Consistent with our data that PI3K/Akt activation is upstream of p38 MAPK activation by CO during A-R (Fig. 2C), when we blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, CO lost its ability to decrease STAT1 and increase STAT3 activation during A-R (Fig. 2D, lane 4).

However, this molecular mechanism of activation is not yet understood. We show here that endogenous TAK1 is constitutively associated with TAB1 and phosphorylated following IL-1 stimulation. Furthermore, TAK1 is constitutively phosphorylated when ectopically overexpressed with TAB1. In both cases, dephosphorylation of TAK1 renders it inactive, but it can be reactivated by preincubation with ATP. A mutant of TAK1 that lacks kinase activity is not phosphorylated either following IL-1 treatment or when coexpressed with TAB1, indicating that TAK1 phosphorylation is due to autophosphorylation. Furthermore, mutation to alanine of a conserved serine residue (Ser-192) in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII abolishes both phosphorylation and activation of TAK1. These results suggest that IL-1 and ectopic expression of TAB1 both activate TAK1 via autophosphorylation of Ser-192.",

Exhibiting an (Nrf2-independent) expression profile characteristic for phase 1 genes, which is also supported by a previous promoter analysis (Xie et al., 1996), this gene was found to be constitutively upregulated > 12-fold in lung tissue of unexposed mice exhibiting a Clara cell–specific conditional knock out in the keap1 gene (Jon Maher and Keiko Taguchi, unpublished observation). Thus, we conclude that aldh3a1 is targeted by both the Ah receptor and the Nrf2 pathway, supporting the concept that drug-processing genes may be activated by an AhR-Nrf2 signaling axis (Yeager et al., 2009).",

Studies on the regulatory elements of the oxidative stress-inducible gene heme oxygenase-1 (hmox1) using various hmox1 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs revealed that the strong CS-dependent expression of this gene is primarily governed by the distal enhancers 1 (\\\"E1\\\") and 2 (\\\"E2\\\"), which both contain three canonical ARE-like stress-responsive elements (StREs). Notably, depletion of Nrf2 levels caused by RNA interference or deletion of E1 or E2 sites significantly compromised CS-induced hmox1 promoter activation, based on the distinct Nrf2 sensitivity exhibited by E1 and E2.

We showed previously that phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase plays an essential role in ARE-mediated rGSTA2 induction by oxidative stress. In view of the fact that the signaling pathway of PI3-kinase controls microfilaments and translocation of actin-associated proteins, the current study was designed to investigate the PI3-kinase-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and the interaction of Nrf2 with actin. tert-Butylhydroquinone (t-BHQ) caused Nrf2 to translocate into the nucleus in H4IIE cells, which was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with PI3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin/LY294002). t-BHQ relocalized Nrf2 in concert with changes in actin microfilament architecture, as visualized by superposition of immunochemically stained Nrf2 and fluorescent phalloidin-stained actin. Furthermore, t-BHQ increased the level of nuclear actin, coimmunoprecipitated with Nrf2, which returned to that of control by pretreatment of the cells with PI3-kinase inhibitors. Cytochalasin B, an actin disruptor, alone stimulated actin-mediated nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and induced rGSTA2. In contrast, phalloidin, an agent that prevents actin filaments from depolymerization, inhibited Nrf2 translocation and rGSTA2 induction by t-BHQ. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analyses allowed us to detect both 57- and 100-kDa Nrf2. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation assays showed that the 100-kDa protein comprised both Nrf2 and actin. The present study demonstrates that the PI3-kinase signaling pathway regulates rearrangement of actin microfilaments in response to oxidative stress and that depolymerization of actin causes a complex of Nrf2 bound with actin to translocate into nucleus.",

Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis revealed that Nox4 and p22(phox), but not Nox2 or p47(phox), are localized in nuclei of HPAECs. Further, knockdown of Nox4 with siRNA decreased Nox4 nuclear expression significantly. Exposure of HPAECs to hyperoxia (3-24 h) enhanced mRNA and protein expression of Nox4, and Nox4 siRNA decreased hyperoxia-induced ROS production. Interestingly,",

The additive influence of three cis-acting elements is responsible for this regulation in an adrenal carcinoma cell line. Two sites, CRE2 at -48 base pairs (bp) relative to the start of transcription and CRE3 at +95 bp, are identical to the core motif of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) of the somatostatin gene and are conserved in the mouse, rat, and human ODC genes. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in a substantial decrease in basal promoter activity, as well as a 5-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter by PKA. CRE3 did not contribute to the basal activity of the ODC promoter, but mutation of this site resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility by PKA. Deletion of a 45-bp sequence (GC-box) located 5' of CRE2, also resulted in a 2-fold decrease in inducibility of the ODC promoter. DNase I protection revealed the presence of protein binding at CRE2, the TATA box, and the GC-box of the ODC promoter. Mutation of CRE2 resulted in loss of protection of this sequence, as well as the 3' extension of the footprint over the TATA box, without affecting interactions at the GC box. Antibodies to the well characterized CRE-binding protein CREB recognized proteins binding to CRE2, suggesting that binding of CREB, or an antigenically related protein, is important for the activity of CRE2. Additionally, recombinant CREB bound to a DNA probe containing the CRE2 sequence.",

This regulation is mediated by direct activation of f-channels by cAMP (50, 128), which facilitates channel opening (126). DiFrancesco and Tortora (128) failed to observe a direct regulation of SAN f-channels by purified protein kinase A (PKA) (128). In SAN cells, direct regulation of voltage dependence by cAMP can quantitatively account for If regulation by autonomic agonists (126). The existence of a PKA-mediated regulation of If has been suggested by Chang et al. (80) in canine Purkinje cells and in murine stem cells derived from cardiomyocytes (1). Intracellular Ca2+ have been reported to positively regulate If by either increasing current conductance (171) or by positively shifting the current voltage dependence (416). The mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulate If has not been elucidated. Inside-out patch-clamp experiments seem to exclude a direct Ca2+ effect on f-channels (540).",

The activation of Ras also requires stimulation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, through its interaction with receptor substrates such as Gab-1 or IRS1/2. Activated ERK can translocate into the nucleus, where it catalyses the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as p62TCF, Blockade of the pathway with dominant negative mutants or pharmacological inhibitors prevents the stimulation of cell growth by insulin, but has no effect on the metabolic actions of the hormone54. Insulin increases synthesis and blocks the degradation of proteins through activation of mTOR. The stimulation of this protein kinase involves PI(3)K activation, although another signal may also be required56. mTOR can control the mammalian translation machinery by direct phosphorylation and activation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70rsk)57, as well as phosphorylation of the initiation factor 4E for eukaryotic translation (eIF-4E) inhibitor, PHAS1 or 4E-binding protein 1 (ref. 58). P70rsk activates ribosome biosynthesis by phosphorylating the ribosomal S6 protein, producing increased translation of mRNAs with a 58-terminal oligopyrimidine tract. P70rsk also requires a second PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent phosphorylation, presumably catalysed by PDK1. Phosphorylation of PHAS-1 by mTOR results in its dissociation from eIF-2, allowing capdependent translation of mRNAs with a highly structured 58-untranslated region. Although the mechanism of activation of mTOR remains unclear, it seems to require the presence of amino acids in the media for full activation by growth factors, and thus may also represent a nutrient sensor55. Glucose and lipid regulation Regulation of glycogen synthesis Insulin stimulates glycogen accumulation through a coordinated increase in glucose transport and glycogen synthesis. The hormone activates glycogen synthase by promoting its dephosphorylation, through the inhibition of kinases such as PKA or GSK-3 (ref. 59), and activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)60.",

High phosphorylation of PLB and RyRs generates periodical LCICR causing INCX-mediated membrane voltage oscillations, which contribute to the control of the chronotropic state of the cell (43, 508). .....Figure 23. In pacemaker cells, high basal cAMP-mediated PKA-dependent phosphorylation stimulates a perpetual \\\"free running\\\" Ca2+ cycling by pumping Ca2+ into the SR via SERCA2 and LCICR via RyRs. PKA also stimulates Ca2+ entry through Cav1.3-mediated ICa,L. The thick red line indicates the persistent spontaneous Ca2+ cycling. The possibility that Cav3.1-mediated ICa,T can contribute to replenishment of SR Ca2+ stores is suggested. Spontaneous LCICR from SR is linked to the diastolic depolarization via Ca2+ activation of inward INCX current. Direct cAMP-dependent activation of HCN channels or cAMP-mediated, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Cav1.3 channels and Ist (dashed lines) strongly stimulates the pacemaker cycle driven by the \\\"membrane ion channels clock\\\" (MCC). It is conceivable that the MCC can entrain the intracellular Ca2+ clock because of the dependency of SR Ca2+ content from VDCCs. (see Fig 23 for detail)",

This action of the hormone is due in part to the acute regulation of metabolic enzymes through changes in their phosphorylation state. In fat, liver, and muscle, insulin stimulates the dephosphorylation of a number of enzymes involved in glycogen and lipid metabolism via activation of protein phosphatases. Numerous studies have indicated that protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) is the primary phosphatase involved in insulin action. Although PP1 is a cytosolic protein, the phosphatase is compartmentalized in cells by discrete targeting subunits. These proteins confer substrate specificity to PP1 and mediate the specific regulation of intracellular pools of PP1 by a variety of extracellular signals. Four proteins have been described that target the phosphatase to the glycogen particle. G(M) and GL are expressed exclusively in striated muscle and liver, while protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) and R6 are more widely expressed. Despite a common targeting function, these four proteins are not highly conserved, suggesting profound differences in the mechanisms by which they contribute to the hormonal regulation of PP1 activity. Overexpression studies in cell lines or animals have revealed major differences among these proteins regarding basal glycogen levels and hormonal responsiveness. Furthermore, alterations in the expression or function of PP1 glycogen-targeting subunits may contribute to the onset of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.",

This effect was prevented by the D(2)-receptor antagonist sulpiride and domperidone. The increase in MAO-A protein was preceded by an augmentation of MAO-A mRNA that was prevented by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Bromocriptine effect was mimicked by the PKA inhibitor H89 and inhibited by the PKA activator 8-bromo-cAMP.

This shows that CRE is essential, and that under ex vivo conditions CREB and SREBP cooperate in transactivating CYP51. Interestingly, protein kinase A shows a marked stimulation of the CYP51 promoter activity when overexpressed together with SREBP-1a but not when overexpressed with CREB, suggesting phosphorylation of SREBP-1a. Using a DNA probe containing all three regulatory elements, it is found that SREBP-1a, a CREB-like factor, and specificity protein (Sp1) all probably bind the CYP51 promoter. While SREBP-1a and the CRE-bound proteins are essential for the SREBP-dependent response, Sp1 apparently functions only to maximize sterol regulation of CYP51.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

We and others have previously demonstrated that Ras activates the inherent transcriptional activation function of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Supportive of the importance of NF-kappaB in transformation, Ras-induced cellular transformation can be suppressed by expression of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or by dominant-negative forms of the upstream activator IkappaB kinase (IKK). However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.",

However, downstream signaling pathways activated by non-bacterial agonists are not known. Thus, we determined the downstream signaling pathways derived from saturated fatty acid-induced TLR4 activation. Saturated fatty acid (lauric acid)-induced NFkB activation was inhibited by a dominant negative (DN) mutant of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, TRAF6, or IkBa in macrophages (RAW264.7) and 293T cells transfected with TLR4 and MD-2. Lauric acid induced the transient phosphorylation of AKT. LY294002, PI3K(DN), or AKT(DN) inhibited NFkB activation, p65 transactivation, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression induced by lauric acid or constitutively active (CA) TLR4. AKT(DN) blocked MyD88-induced NFkB activation suggesting that AKT is a MyD88-dependent downstream signaling component of TLR4. AKT(CA) was sufficient to induce NFkB activation and COX-2 expression. These results demonstrate that NFkB activation and COX-2 expression induced by lauric acid is at least partly mediated through TLR4/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In contrast, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT induced by LPS or lauric acid. DHA also suppressed NFkB activation induced by TLR4(CA), but not MyD88(CA) or AKT(CA) suggesting that the molecular targets of DHA are signaling components upstream of MyD88 and AKT. Together, these results suggest that saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids reciprocally modulate the activation of TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathways involving MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 and PI3K/AKT, and further suggest a possibility that TLR4-mediated target gene expression and cellular responses are also differentially modulated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.",

This data establishes the IL-12 p35 gene as a new target of c-Rel and shows that the regulation of IL-12 p70 expression at the transcriptional level by Rel/NF-kappaB is controlled through both the p35 and p40 genes in a cell type-specific fashion.",

Microbial-activated TL1A was in part mediated by TLR 1, 2, 4, and 9 signaling pathways and dependent on downstream p38 MAP kinase and NF-kappaB activation (Fig. 1) [46]. Negative regulators of the TL1A signaling pathway also exist and may serve to maintain gut immune homeostasis. Our group showed that TLR8 or TLR7/8 ligand (R848) can inhibit TL1A production in a dose dependent manner [47•].",

LPS stimulation induces NADPH oxidase activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PMNs as well as the initiation of MyD88-dependent NF-ÃŽÂºB signaling in endothelial cells and the consequent expression of TLR2 and ICAM-1. Adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMNs to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells. The oxidants augment NF-ÃŽÂºB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells and increased PMN migration. Thus, the PMN NADPH oxidaseÃ¢â‚¬â€œmediated TLR4-TLR2 cross talk activates a positive feedback signal leading to sustained and amplified endothelial activation in response to invading pathogens.",

The Rel homology domain consists of three regions, including a nuclear localization sequence, a DNA-binding domain, and a dimerization region [405]. Functional NF- kB is composed of dimers formed from p50, p52, Rel A (p65), Rel B, and c-Rel proteins [412-414]. In unstimulated cells, the nuclear localization sequence of NF-kB is bound to inhibitory proteins (IkB), thus maintaining it in the cytosol [415]. IkB proteins include IkBa [416] IkBb [417], IkBg [418,419], and possibly Bcl-3 [420,421]. Interestingly, the proteins previously believed to be precursor proteins of p50 and p52 known as p105 [422,423] and p100 [424] also exhibit IkB activity [424-426]. Recently, it was found that both p105 and p50 are generated from the same transcript but that the p105 protein is not actually a precursor of p50 [427]. The best studied of the IkB proteins is IkBa. Stimulation of cells leads to hyperphosphorylation of IkBaserines 32 and 36 [428-431] via activation of Nik, which phosphorylates IkB kinase (Fig. 2) [432-434]. Phosphorylation alone has no effect on the binding of the inhibitor to NF-kB [430,435,436]; however, it does provide a signal for ubiquitination at lysines 21 and 22 [437-439], which stimulates degradation of IkBaby the 26S proteasome complex. Dissociation of IkB and NF-kB proteins permits migration of the active NF-kB dimer to the nucleus [440], where it can bind to DNA and initiate transcription. ROS activate NF-kB by causing the release of the inhibitory subunit (IkB) from the NF-kB complex [11].",

To elucidate molecular mechanisms possibly linking these events, as well as to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the cyclopentenone prostaglandin A1 (PGA1), an inducer of heat shock proteins (HSPs), we exposed human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells to the complex I inhibitor rotenone. Dose-dependent apoptosis was preceded by the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and then the activation of caspase-3 over the ensuing 24 h. PGA1 increased the expression of HSP70 and HSP27 and protected against rotenone-induced apoptosis, without increasing necrotic death. PGA1 blocked the rotenone-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and attenuated, but did not abolish, the caspase-3 elevation. Unexpectedly, the caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD.CHO (DEVD), at a concentration that completely prevented the caspase-3 elevation produced by rotenone, failed to protect against apoptosis. These results suggest that complex I deficiency in dopamine cells can induce apoptosis by a process involving early NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and caspase-3 activation. PGA1 appears to protect against rotenone-induced cell death by inducing HSPs and blocking nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in a process that attenuates caspase-3 activation, but is not mediated by its inhibition.",

              "summary_text": "Endocrine therapy with an estrogen receptor (ER)-targeted antiestrogen, such as tamoxifen, or estrogen ablation by aromatase inhibitors is clinically indicated for the management of all forms of ER-positive breast cancer. However, 30-50% of ER-positive breast cancer cases fail to benefit clinically from endocrine therapy alone, and recent molecular evidence suggests that 'crosstalk' pathways originating from activated receptor tyrosine kinases and/or other proliferative and survival signals may be contributing to this endocrine resistance. Molecular identification and validation of candidate ER crosstalking pathways will likely lead to clinically important prognostic markers and targets for the application of novel therapeutics in combination with standard endocrine agents. This review focuses on a critical survival and proliferation pathway involving activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors that for nearly two decades have been known to be critical regulators of mammalian immune and inflammatory responses, and more recently have been associated with chemotherapy resistance. With the demonstration that activation of NFkappaB is absolutely required for normal mammary gland development, NFkappaB involvment in human breast cancers was initially explored and linked to the development of hormone-independent (ER-negative) breast cancer. Newer clinical evidence now implicates NFkappaB activation, particularly DNA-binding by the p50 subunit of NFkappaB, as a potential prognostic marker capable of identifying a high-risk subset of ER-positive, primary breast cancers destined for early relapse despite adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen. Furthermore, initial preclinical studies suggest that treatment strategies designed to prevent or interrupt activation of NFkappaB in cell-line models of these more aggressive, ER-positive breast cancers can restore their sensitivity to such standard endocrine agents as tamoxifen.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

RALA hepatocytes were transiently transfected with the AP-1-driven firefly luciferase reporter construct Coll73-Luc, and the constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK for normalization. No significant increase in AP-1 transcriptional activity occurred in Ad5LacZ-infected cells at 4 hours after TNF treatment (Fig. 1B).

Furthermore, cotransfection with a construct expressing myristoylated Akt increased NF-kB activity in parental and T691 cells by 4 and 3-fold respectively over the empty vector but no change when expressed with mutant Akt.

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

A strong driving force in sustaining the long lasting efforts to understand the function and regulation of MYC is its potent role as an oncoprotein in human tumors. The first myc gene emerged almost 30 years ago when it was realized that several highly transforming chicken retroviruses had captured a cellular sequence that transformed myeloid cells among others, hence the name myc for myelomonocytic leukemia (1, 2). In mammals several MYC genes, includingMYC(formerly c-MYC, gene and protein symbols as proposed by the Human Genome Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/ index.html)), MYCN, and MYCL, have been identified. All three have been implicated in the genesis of human malignancies and suffer in many instances from different genetic alterations, including translocations and amplifications (for a more detailed overview see supplemental Fig. S1) (3, 4). In addition the MYC promoter is targeted by multiple signal transduction cascades, including the WNT, RAS/RAF/MAPK,2 JAK/STAT, transforming growth factor beta, and NF-kappaB pathways, that are deregulated in cancer cells and contribute to enhanced MYC expression (5, 6). These tumor-associated alterations in general deregulate and enhance MYC expression.",

DNA-binding and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed binding of p300 to several DNA-bound transactivators at basal state. Following stimulation with LPS plus IFN-gamma, binding of p300, p50/p65 NF-kappaB, and IFN-regulatory factor-1 was increased by approximately 2-fold. Nuclear p50 was complexed with and acetylated by p300 at the basal binding state which was increased by LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation. p300 overexpression resulted in increased p50 acetylation which was reduced by HAT mutation. p50 acetylation correlated with increased NF-kappaB binding and enhanced p300 recruitment. Co-overexpression of E1A abolished the augmentation of p50 acetylation and p50 binding induced by p300 overexpression, and a correlative suppression of p300 recruitment to the complex. We conclude that p300 is essential for iNOS transcription. Our results suggest that p300 HAT acetylates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB, thereby increasing NF-kappaB binding and NF-kappaB mediated transactivation.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

In cells lacking p53, E2F-1 can act through p73, a member of p53 family that activates some of the same target genes as p53.

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

PARP-1 and p300 synergistically coactivated NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression in response to TNFalpha and LPS. Furthermore, PARP-1 interacted directly with p300 and enhanced the interaction of NF-kappaB1/p50 to p300. The C terminus, harboring the catalytic domain of PARP-1 but not its enzymatic activity, was required for complete transcriptional coactivation of NF-kappaB by p300 in response to TNFalpha and LPS. Together, these results indicate that PARP-1 acts synergistically with p300 and plays an essential regulatory role in NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression.",

SSH revealed expression of the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP; also known as p97) to be constitutively activated in LM8 cells, but it declined in Dunn cells when the cells became confluent. Because VCP is known to be involved in the ubiquitination process of Inhibitor-kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha), an inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), whether VCP influences NFkappaB activation or not was examined by using VCP-transfected Dunn cells (Dunn/VCPs). When stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), Dunn/VCPs showed constantly activated NFkappaB, although in the original Dunn cells and control vector transfectant (Dunn/Dunn-c) NFkappaB activation ceased when the cells became confluent. Western immunoblot analysis showed an increase of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha (p-IkappaBalpha) in the cytoplasm of confluent Dunn/Dunn-c cells compared to that of Dunn/VCPs. Therefore, decrease of p-IkappaBalpha degrading activity might be responsible for the decrease in NFkappaB activation. In vitro apoptosis assay demonstrated increased apoptosis rates of Dunn/Dunn-c cells after TNFalpha stimulation compared to those of Dunn/VCPs and LM8 cells. In vivo metastasis assay showed increased incidences of metastatic events in Dunn/VCP-1 inoculated male C3H mice compared to those in Dunn/Dunn-c inoculated mice. These findings suggested that VCP expression plays an important role in the metastatic process. Anti-apoptotic potential in these cells owing to constant NFkappaB activation via efficient cytoplasmic p-IkappaBalpha degrading activity may explain the increased metastatic potential of these cells.",

Binding started to decrease after 60 min, with basal levels reached by 120 min. Specific NF-{kappa}B binding was competed out with excess unlabeled probe (Fig. 8B). Specific localization of the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-{kappa}B complex involved in promoter binding was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Fibroblasts in eight-well chamber slides were treated with 1% CSE for 1 h and then stained for p50 and p65 (Fig. 8C). Fibroblasts treated with medium alone had a diffuse p50 and p65 staining in the cytoplasm, and only weak staining was observed in the nucleus, explaining NF-{kappa}B basal binding observed during EMSA analysis. CSE treatment led to translocation of both subunits observed as increased staining in the nucleus (shown by arrows) and decreased cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 8C).

Remarkably, aspirin dramatically decreased endotoxin-induced resistin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). Both aspirin (via IkB kinase) and rosiglitazone (via PPARg) inhibit NF-kB [31,32], which is activated by LPS. Indeed, treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-kB activation [33], abrogated endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of the macrophages with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF-kB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation [34], nearly abolished endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (Figure 4D).

Metformin has been shown to activate AMPK. We hypothesized that metformin may prevent nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines. Metformin was observed to activate AMPK, as well as its downstream target, phosphoacetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Metformin also dose-dependently inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha-induced IkappaB kinase activity. Furthermore, metformin attenuated the TNF-alpha-induced gene expression of various proinflammatory and cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in HUVECs. A pharmacological activator of AMPK, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside (AICAR), dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced NF-kappaB reporter gene expression. AICAR also suppressed the TNF-alpha- and interleukin-1beta-induced gene expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in HUVECs. The small interfering RNA for AMPKalpha1 attenuated metformin or AICAR-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by TNF-alpha, suggesting a possible role of AMPK in the regulation of cell inflammation. In light of these findings, we suggest that metformin attenuates the cytokine-induced expression of proinflammatory and adhesion molecule genes by inhibiting NF-kappaB activation via AMPK activation. Thus, it might be useful to target AMPK signaling in future efforts to prevent atherogenic and inflammatory vascular disease.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

LPS targets the transmembranous patternrecognition receptor called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on macrophages and monocytes[56]. LPS binding to TLR4 activates signal transduction through MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase and TRAF6 to activate the NF-?B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways[57-59], which leads to the synthesis and release of infl ammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-8 and TNF-?, various chemokines GRO?, IP10, MIG and MIP -1? & ?[60], iNOS[61,62] and antimicrobial peptides providing a critical link to the adaptive immune system[63,64].Induction of infl ammation is an important component in the defence against H pylori. The presence of H pylori leads to the release of mutagenic substances such as metabolites of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is known to promote oncogenesis[65]. Nitric oxide generated by iNOS is converted to reactive nitrogen species, which can exert oncogenic effects including direct DNA and protein damage, inhibition of apoptosis, mutation of DNA and cellular repair functions such as p53 and also promotion of angiogenesis[66]. H pylori infection is also known to induce the expression of pro-infl ammatory Cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2)[67-71]. COX-2 expression is normally undetectable in most normal tissues, but is induced rapidly during an inflammatory reaction[72,73]. Cox-2 activity is induced by a variety of mediators including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-?, interferon-? and IL-1[74]. COX-2 facilitates tumour growth by inhibiting apoptosis, maintaining cell proliferation and stimulating angiogenesis within cancer cells[75-77].",

Cse4p has a unique 135-amino-acid N terminus and a C-terminal histone-fold domain that is more than 60% identical to histone H3 and the mammalian centromere protein CENP-A. Cse4p and CENP-A have biochemical properties similar to H3 and probably replace H3 in centromere-specific nucleosomes in yeasts and mammals, respectively. In order to identify regions of Cse4p that distinguish it from H3 and confer centromere function, a systematic site-directed mutational analysis was performed. Nested deletions of the Cse4p N terminus showed that this region of the protein contains at least one essential domain. The C-terminal histone-fold domain of Cse4p was analyzed by changing Cse4p amino acids that differ between Cse4p and H3 to the analogous H3 residues. Extensive substitution of contiguous Cse4p residues with H3 counterparts resulted in cell lethality. However, all large lethal substitution alleles could be subdivided into smaller viable alleles, many of which caused elevated rates of mitotic chromosome loss. The results indicate that residues critical for wild-type Cse4p function and high-fidelity chromosome transmission are distributed across the entire histone-fold domain. Our findings are discussed in the context of the known structure of H3 within the nucleosome and compared with previous results reported for CENP-A.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

To further substantiate that the observed NF-kappa B-dependent IL-1 beta induction of the human NK-1R gene is regulated via a transcriptional event through this NF-kappa B site on the NK-1R gene promoter, we transfected THP-1 cells with a luciferase promoter-reporter construct containing the 5' promoter region of the human NK-1R gene. Exposure of these cells to IL-1 beta or overexpression of NF-kappa B cDNAs resulted in a significant increase in the amount of luciferase activity that was diminished greatly in cells transfected with I kappa B alpha, the NF-kappa B inhibitor.",

The role of NF-kappaB in the cumulative changes in gene expression with transformation and progression of the murine SCC Pam 212 and after switching off NF-kappaB by a dominant negative inhibitor kappaB mutant (IkappaBalphaM) was explored by profiling with a 15,000-element cDNA micoarrray. Remarkably, NF-kappaB modulated the expression of 60% of the 308 genes differentially expressed between normal keratinocytes and metastatic SCCs. NF-kappaB directly or indirectly modulated expression of programs of genes functionally linked to proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and angiogenesis. Among these, changes in expression of cyclin D1, inhibitor of apoptosis-1, mutant Trp53, and beta-catenin detected with modulation of NF-kappaB by microarray were confirmed by Western and Northern blot. NF-kappaB DNA binding motifs were detected in the promoter of approximately 63% of genes showing increased expression and 33% of the genes showing decreased expression. The ACTACAG motif implicated in the NF-kappaB-dependent down-regulation of mRNA expression of MyoD and Sox9 was detected in the coding portion of about 15% of genes showing increased or decreased expression. Inactivation of NF-kappaB inhibited malignant phenotypic features including proliferation, cell survival, migration, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. These results provide evidence that NF-kappaB is an important modulator of gene expression programs that contribute to the malignant phenotype of SCC.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Both aspirin (via IkB kinase) and rosiglitazone (via PPARg) inhibit NF-kB [31,32], which is activated by LPS. Indeed, treatment of the macrophages with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which prevents NF-kB activation [33], abrogated endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (data not shown). Moreover, treatment of the macrophages with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that specifically prevents activation of NF-kB by inhibiting its nuclear translocation [34], nearly abolished endotoxin-induced activation of resistin expression (Figure 4D).

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

However, the molecular mechanism of this pathway remains unclear. In this report we demonstrate that both NIK and IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) are involved in LTbetaR signaling and that the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit at serine 536 in its transactivation domain 1 (TA1) plays an essential role. We also found that NF-kappaB could be activated in the LTbetaR pathway without altering the level of the phosphorylation of IkappaB and nuclear localization of p65. By using a heterologous transactivation system in which Gal4-dependent reporter gene is activated by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in fusion with various portions of p65, we found that TA1 serves as a direct target in the NIK-IKKalpha pathway. In addition, mutation studies have revealed the essential role of Ser-536 within TA1 of p65 in transcriptional control mediated by NIK-IKKalpha. Furthermore, we found that Ser-536 was phosphorylated following the stimulation of LTbetaR, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by the kinase-dead dominant-negative mutant of either NIK or IKKalpha. These observations provide evidence for a crucial role of the NIK-IKKalpha cascade for NF-kappaB activation in LTbetaR signaling.",

RA synovial fibroblasts were pretreated with Bay 11-7082 for 30 min, washed and subsequently stimulated with PGN for 4 h. Total RNA was then extracted and RANTES, GCP-2, and MCP-2 mRNA quantified by real-time PCR. There was a dose-dependent decrease of mRNA levels of the tested chemokines ranging from marked reduction upon treatment with 1 µM Bay 11-7082 to almost complete inhibition in the RA synovial fibroblasts pretreated with 5 µM Bay 11-7082.

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

This suggests that HuR facilitates the phosphorylation of NF?B in LPS-treated cells and the nuclear translocation of NF?B. We then performed ChIP analysis in which immunoprecipitated samples by NF?B antibody were subjected to PCR amplification by using primers for the human VCAM-1 promoter region that NF?B binds (34). As shown in Fig. 4F, withHuR knockdown, no VCAM-1 can be detected in the ChIP assay in LPStreated cells, in shape contrast with LPS-treated control (NS siRNAtransfected) cellswhere a high level ofVCAM-1 was detected. These results suggest that NF?B is responsible formediating HuR-induced VCAM-1 up-regulation in LPS-treated HUVECs.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

LOX-1 activation also plays an important role in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. A number of studies show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce total LDL cholesterol and exert a cardioprotective effect. We examined the modulation of LOX-1 expression and its function by two different statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin, in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). We observed that ox-LDL (40 microg/ml) treatment up-regulated the expression of E- and P-selectins, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in HCAECs. Ox-LDL mediated these effects via LOX-1, since antisense to LOX-1 mRNA decreased LOX-1 expression and subsequent adhesion molecule expression. Pretreatment of HCAECs with simvastatin or atorvastatin (1 and 10 microM) reduced ox-LDL-induced expression of LOX-1 as well as adhesion molecules (all P microM) was more potent than the low concentration (1 microM) (P Both statins reduced ox-LDL-mediated activation of the redox-sensitive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) but not AP-1.

We evaluated the effects of DNA-binding small molecules on hypoxia-inducible transcription of VEGF. A synthetic pyrrole-imidazole polyamide designed to bind the hypoxia response element (HRE) was found to disrupt hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) binding to HRE. In cultured HeLa cells, this resulted in a reduction of VEGF mRNA and secreted protein levels. The observed effects were polyamide-specific and dose-dependent. Analysis of genome-wide effects of the HRE-specific polyamide revealed that a number of hypoxia-inducible genes were down-regulated. Pathway-based regulation of hypoxia-inducible gene expression with DNA-binding small molecules may represent a new approach for targeting angiogenesis.",

Because HIF-1a is involved in Met gene expression, the constitutive activation of HIF-1a as a consequence of pVHL deregulation provides a mechanism explaining the observation that the expression of HGF and Met receptor is associated with genetic alterations of VHL in primary RCC. Hypoxic cell sensitisation to HGF has therefore been proposed as an invasive switch that facilitates cell movement away from an area of low oxygen availability, and is dependent on the ability of pVHL to degrade HIFa (Figure 4). The gene encoding the chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been discovered as a novel HIF target based on a microarray comparison of genetic profiles derived from VHL-null RCC cells and their isogenic wild-type VHLexpressing counterparts [52].",

To determine whether HIF-1 also mediates cell-autonomous responses to hypoxia, we have compared gene expression profiles in arterial endothelial cells cultured under nonhypoxic versus hypoxic conditions and in nonhypoxic cells infected with adenovirus encoding beta-galactosidase versus a constitutively active form of HIF-1alpha (AdCA5). There were 245 gene probes that showed at least 1.5-fold increase in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5; 325 gene probes showed at least 1.5-fold decrease in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5. The largest category of genes down-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded proteins involved in cell growth/proliferation. Many genes up-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded cytokines/growth factors, receptors, and other signaling proteins. Transcription factors accounted for the largest group of HIF-1-regulated genes, indicating that HIF-1 controls a network of transcriptional responses to hypoxia in endothelial cells. Infection of endothelial cells with AdCA5 under nonhypoxic conditions was sufficient to induce increased basement membrane invasion and tube formation similar to the responses induced by hypoxia, indicating that HIF-1 mediates cell-autonomous activation of endothelial cells.",

If true, such a model would strongly support the HIF system as an anticancer target.  Several studies have sought to test this model genetically in studies of experimental tumor formation by cells that are defective in particular components of the HIF pathway. The first of these used a series of mouse hepatoma cells that are functionally defective for HIF-1beta and cannot form an active HIF complex. When grown as subcutaneous tumors, the mutant cells manifest a near-total loss of the peri-necrotic enhancement of VEGF gene expression that is apparent in wild-type cells. This was associated with marked reductions in tumor angiogenesis and growth rates106. Similar reductions in growth and vascular density in tumors grown from human colon and breast carcinoma cell lines have been observed after expression of a peptide that antagonizes HIF transcription by abrogating the interaction of HIF-alpha and p300 (ref. 107).",

The target genes for HIF-1 include VEGF and leptin, and expression of both of these has been shown to be stimulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to hypoxia (Lolmede et al. 2003).",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

To determine whether HIF-1 also mediates cell-autonomous responses to hypoxia, we have compared gene expression profiles in arterial endothelial cells cultured under nonhypoxic versus hypoxic conditions and in nonhypoxic cells infected with adenovirus encoding beta-galactosidase versus a constitutively active form of HIF-1alpha (AdCA5). There were 245 gene probes that showed at least 1.5-fold increase in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5; 325 gene probes showed at least 1.5-fold decrease in expression in response to hypoxia and in response to AdCA5. The largest category of genes down-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded proteins involved in cell growth/proliferation. Many genes up-regulated by both hypoxia and AdCA5 encoded cytokines/growth factors, receptors, and other signaling proteins. Transcription factors accounted for the largest group of HIF-1-regulated genes, indicating that HIF-1 controls a network of transcriptional responses to hypoxia in endothelial cells. Infection of endothelial cells with AdCA5 under nonhypoxic conditions was sufficient to induce increased basement membrane invasion and tube formation similar to the responses induced by hypoxia, indicating that HIF-1 mediates cell-autonomous activation of endothelial cells.",

The extrinsic death pathway is initiated by binding of the extracellular ligands, TNFa (tumour necrosis factor-a) or FAS (apoptosis antigen-1) ligand (FASL), to death receptors TNFR1 (TNF-receptor1) and FAS. TNFR1 activation leads to the formation of a TRADD RIP TRAF2 (TNF receptor death domain receptor interacting protein TNF associated factor 2) complex, which signals through the NFkB (nuclear factorkB) survival pathway (blue lines) or the JNK (cJun N teminal kinase)death pathway (black lines). RIP activates procaspase 2 and cleaves BID (BH3 (BCL2 (B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2) homology domain 3) interacting agonist). The TRADD FADD FLICE (TNF receptor death domain FAS associated death domain FADD like interleukin 1b) complex activates procaspase 8, triggering apoptosis through caspase 3 or cleavage of BID to tBID (truncated BID). FAS-mediated death occurs through a FADD-mediated activation of procaspase 8 or DAXX (death-associated protein )-mediated activation of JNK. JNK modifies BID to jBID, allowing its translocation to the mitochondrion and release of SMAC/DIABLO (second-mitochondrialderived activator of caspases). The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated at the mitochondrion by diverse stimuli. Membrane permeabilization is mediated by BH3-only proteins, which sequester and inhibit the supression of BAX (B-cell lymphoma 2-associated protein X) by BCL2, allowing mitochondrial BAX translocation and the release of cytochrome c (Cyto c), SMAC/DIABLO, AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) and HTRA2/OMI (high temperature requirement serine protease 2).",

To this end, we incubated identical amounts of in vitro translated 35S-PARP, a death substrate cleaved by the active FLICE, with extracts from control or PED-overexpressing cells stimulated with IgMFAS. A major band, corresponding to the 26 kDa cleavage product of 35S-PARP was identified after incubation with extracts from IgMFAS-stimulated control cells (Figure 8). The intensity of the band was fivefold lower after PARP incubation with extracts from FAS-unstimulated cells. Most important, in this assay, PARP cleavage was threefold less effective in PED overexpressing than in control cells. No 26 kDa band was detectable in the absence of cell extract addition. Thus, cleavage of death substrates by active FLICE occurs less efficiently in cells overexpressing PED.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Although vascular SMC are known to express the ET(B)-R, its transcriptional regulation has not been studied thus far. Here we demonstrate that the potent inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaB activation, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC; 30-100 microM), induces de novo ET(B)-R expression in rat aortic and mesenteric cultured SMC. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses revealed that besides inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB, PDTC enhances activator protein-1 (AP-1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and GATA-2 activity in these cells. Preincubation of PDTC-stimulated cells with appropriate decoy oligodeoxynucleotides confirmed the involvement of these three transcription factors, namely that of AP-1, in ET(B)-R expression. The stimulatory effect of PDTC on ET(B)-R expression was also confirmed functionally by monitoring an enhanced ET-1-induced apoptosis in PDTC-treated cells that was sensitive to the ET(B)-R antagonist, BQ788. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that C/EBP, GATA-2, and in particular AP-1 can control ET(B)-R expression in vascular SMC. They further support the notion that ET(B)-R expression in these cells may play an important role in cardiovascular complications, such as restenosis following angioplasty that in the early phase is characterized by prominent SMC apoptosis.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The best characterized of these is the MyD88-dependent pathway, common to all TLRs except TLR3, which results in rapid activation of the transcription molecules nuclear factor ?B (NF-?B), activator protein 1 and Elk-1 and induction of proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor-? (TNF-?), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2.13,14 Activation of the NF-?B p65 and activator protein 1 transcription factors is reduced in endotoxin-tolerant cells.15 TLR7, -8 and -9 can also induce type I interferon (IFN) production in a MyD88-dependent manner, involving the activation of the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF-5)16 and IRF-717 transcription factors. The second, less well-studied pathway is thought to be limited to TLR3 and TLR4. TLR signalling via the adaptor molecules Toll/IL-1-receptor-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-? (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) activates IRF-3 and IRF-7 and, ultimately, IFN-inducible genes such as IFN-?-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and RANTES, via type I IFN production and autocrine activation of the JAK/STAT pathway",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

GnRHa- and TPA-mediated decrease in the human GnRHR promoter activity was reversed by a specific protein kinase C inhibitor. These findings indicate that the activation of the PKC pathway is important in regulating the human GnRHR gene expression. EMSA studies with alphaT3-1 cells transfected with the Gnrhr reporter construct using anti-c-jun antibody demonstrated the binding of c-jun to the AP-1 binding site of the Gnrhr promoter. It was also demonstrated that mutation of the AP-1 binding site at -1000 to -994 abolished the GnRHa (GnRH agonists) induced inhibition.

This serine proteinase inhibitor specifically colocalizes with filamentous beta-amyloid deposits and recently has been shown to influence both formation and destabilization of beta-amyloid fibrils. In the brain, ACT is expressed in astrocytes, and interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), oncostatin M (OSM), and IL-6/soluble IL-6 receptor complexes control synthesis of this inhibitor. Here, we characterize a molecular mechanism responsible for both IL-1 and TNF-induced expression of ACT gene in astrocytes. We identify the 5' distal IL-1/TNF-responsive enhancer of the ACT gene located 13 kb upstream of the transcription start site. This 413-bp-long enhancer contains three elements, two of which bind nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and one that binds activating protein 1 (AP-1). All of these elements contribute to the full responsiveness of the ACT gene to both cytokines, as determined by deletion and mutational analysis. The 5' NF-kB high-affinity binding site and AP-1 element contribute most to the enhancement of gene transcription in response to TNF and IL-1. In addition, we demonstrate that the 5' untranslated region of the ACT mRNA does not contribute to cytokine-mediated activation. Finally, we find that overexpression of the NF-kB inhibitor (IkB) totally inhibits any activation mediated by the newly identified IL-1/TNF enhancer of the ACT gene.",

              "summary_text": "others clearly are not [19, 43]. In fact, the ROS-induced modulation of gene expression associated with DNA repair can occur in the absence of DNA damage [44]. Some of the effects of UV radiation exposure on various pathways are probably stimulated by DNA damage; however, UVA radiation (320-380 nm), which produces little DNA damage, is effective at inducing expression of collagenase [45], heme oxygenase [46,47], ICAM-1 [48], IL-10 [49], cjun, c-fos, and activation of the JNK MAP kinase pathway [50] and at stimulating increases in ferritin protein [51]. Furthermore, exposure of cells to singlet oxygen generation without light exposure stimulates collagenase production [52].  Redox changes that alter gene expression are not limited to increases in oxidation. Antioxidant treatments can also stimulate increases in the expression of certain genes [53-57]. Although it is possible that autoxidation of antioxidant compounds produces enough ROS to stimulate changes in gene expression through oxidizing rather than reducing mechanisms, this seems improbable. Keogh et al. [55] examined several parameters of oxidation in fibroblasts stimulated to increase c-fos abundance with different antioxidant compounds and found no evidence of increased oxidation; albeit, the antioxidant effects observed were small and were manifested primarily as an increase in GSH concentration. It is also possible that secondary effects of chemical treatments rather than their oxidant/antioxidant properties are responsible for the effects on signal transduction and gene expression. This too seems improbable, because oxidants have been used to block the effects of antioxidant compounds [25,33,58,59] and vice versa [11,26,36,60-77] in a number of independent studies. Choi and Moore [78] examined a series of structural isomers of butylated hydroxytoluene and observed that only those compounds with relatively high antioxidant potential are capable of inducing c-fos.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation.

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case.

Experimental data indicate an important role for oxidative stress and the inflammatory cascade during I/R. We are testing the hypothesis that the mechanism of protection against I/R damage observed in transgenic mice overexpressing human antioxidant enzymes (particularly intracellular glutathione peroxidase) involves the modulation of inflammatory response as well as reduced sensitivity of neurons to cytotoxic cytokines. Transgenic animals show significant reduction of expression of chemokines, IL-6, and cell death-inducing ligands as well as corresponding receptors in a focal cerebral I/R model. Reduction of DNA binding activity of consensus and potential AP-1 binding sites in mouse Fas ligand promoter sequence was observed in nuclear extracts from transgenic mice overexpressing intracellular glutathione peroxidase compared with normal animals following I/R. This effect was accompanied by modulation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway. Cultured primary neurons from the transgenic mice demonstrated protection against hypoxia/reoxygenation injury as well as cytotoxicity after TNF-alpha and Fas ligand treatment. These results indicate that glutathione peroxidase-sensitive reactive oxygen species play an important role in regulation of cell death during cerebral I/R by modulating intrinsic neuronal sensitivity as well as brain inflammatory reactions.",

Loss of BiP binding correlates with the translocation of ATF6 to the Golgi, which was slowed in cells overexpressing BiP. Two Golgi localization signals (GLSs) were identified in ATF6. Removal of BiP binding sites from ATF6, while retaining a GLS, resulted in its constitutive translocation to the Golgi.

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

In addition, SOCS1 induced high levels of p53 and its target, p21; a reduction in Rb phosphorylation; and the inhibition of E2F target genes such as Mcm6 (Figure 3B). Intriguingly, during SOCS1-induced senescence, the increase in p53 levels was accompanied with serine 15 phosphorylation of p53 (Figure 3B) and activation of the DNA damage-regulated kinases ATM and Chk2 (Figure 3C).

These hyperphosphorylations are attributable to DNA-PK (Shao et al., 1999) and independently to ATM (Gately et al., 1998). <s12>  ATM (or an ATM-associated kinase other than DNA-PK or ATM-related protein) hyperphosphorylates RPA2 on serine and threonine residues in response to DNA damage; the reaction is dependent on both ssDNA and linear dsDNA (Gately et al., 1998). <s13> DNA damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of RPA2 prevents the binding of RPA to p53 (Abramova et al., 1997).",

As well as modifying BRCA1, the ATM protein kinase can phosphorylate FANCD2 on several residues, including serine 222, following exposure to ionizing radiation77. Ser222 phosphorylation is required for the intra-S-phase arrest and is, in turn, dependent on the protein kinase NBS1, which is a component of the trimeric MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex78. FANCD2 can also be phosphorylated in an ATM-independent manner by the ATR kinase79,which signals an intra-S-phase arrest that is triggered by ultraviolet radiation or DNA-crosslinking agents46.Here, too, FANCD2 phosphorylation depends on NBS1, which is required to fully enforce the S-phase checkpoint. The participation of FANCD2 in ionizingradiation- activated checkpoint responses through phosphorylation on Ser222 seems to be independent78 of its mono-ubiquitylation on Lys561, which promotes the translocation of FANCD2 to damage-induced nuclear foci that contain BRCA1 and RAD51, and that are presumed sites of DNA repair. Similarly, FANCD2 foci do not require ATR-dependent phosphorylation79.",

As shown in Fig. 2, the fibroblast strains incubated with 1% CSE had a three- to fourfold induction in PGE2 synthesis over basal levels after 24 h, depending on the strain. However, cells treated with both CSE and NS-398 had significantly decreased PGE2 levels relative to fibroblasts treated with CSE alone, supporting the idea that the elevated PGE2 levels are a result of COX-2 activity.

MDR1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the MDR1 gene, is implicated as the primary cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumors where it acts as an efflux pump for chemotherapeutic agents. It is also expressed in normal tissues of the liver and kidney where it functions to actively transport lipophilic xenobiotics. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis confirmed the results of the microarray, showing increased mRNA levels for MDR1 in Cox-2 overexpressing cells.e again confirm that Cox-2 overexpressing RMC have increased MDR1 expression. We also observed that the addition of NS398 blocked the up-regulation of the MDR1 protein, consistent with the R123 efflux assay showing reduced MDR1 activity. These additional results show that the Cox-2-mediated MDR1 response is dependent on Cox-2 activity. ",

              "summary_text": "Mechanisms of cancer promotion by COX-2 are not fully understood, but signaling through prostaglandin (PG)E2 receptors is a contributing factor. The major PGE2 receptors on epithelial cells, EP2 and EP4, increase cAMP production, which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in some cell types.  To explore the hypothesis that PGE2-stimulated cAMP  is a key intracellular mediator of COX-2-dependent antiapoptosis and define the underlying mechanisms, we used the T84 human colon epithelial cell line, which exhibits inducible apoptosis and is responsive to PGE2  stimulation (31, 34, 35). The major PGE2 receptors on colon epithelial cells are EP2 and EP4  (25), a finding we confirmed by RT-PCR of T84 cells (data not shown). Both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP as a second messenger, suggesting that cAMP mediates antiapoptotic functions in epithelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that a membrane-permeant  cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, and CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs regulatory protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl  cyclase, also inhibited Fas- and staurosporine-promoted apoptosis  (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by evidence that CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP also inhibited the formation of apoptosis-associated DNA laddering in T84 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We obtained similar results with the normal rat intestinal epithelial  cell line, RIE-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antiapoptotic response to increases in cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells is independent of their state of transformation and conserved across at least two species.\\\"From full text\\\"",

              "summary_text": "Mechanisms of cancer promotion by COX-2 are not fully understood, but signaling through prostaglandin (PG)E2 receptors is a contributing factor. The major PGE2 receptors on epithelial cells, EP2 and EP4, increase cAMP production, which promotes growth and inhibits apoptosis in some cell types.  To explore the hypothesis that PGE2-stimulated cAMP  is a key intracellular mediator of COX-2-dependent antiapoptosis and define the underlying mechanisms, we used the T84 human colon epithelial cell line, which exhibits inducible apoptosis and is responsive to PGE2  stimulation (31, 34, 35). The major PGE2 receptors on colon epithelial cells are EP2 and EP4  (25), a finding we confirmed by RT-PCR of T84 cells (data not shown). Both EP2 and EP4 receptors activate adenylyl cyclase and increase cAMP as a second messenger, suggesting that cAMP mediates antiapoptotic functions in epithelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we found that a membrane-permeant  cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP, and CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs regulatory protein, leading to the activation of adenylyl  cyclase, also inhibited Fas- and staurosporine-promoted apoptosis  (Fig. 1 A). These findings were confirmed by evidence that CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP also inhibited the formation of apoptosis-associated DNA laddering in T84 cells (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We obtained similar results with the normal rat intestinal epithelial  cell line, RIE-1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the antiapoptotic response to increases in cAMP in intestinal epithelial cells is independent of their state of transformation and conserved across at least two species.\\\"From full text\\\"",

Adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells is mediated by binding of constitutive ICAM-1 to CD18 integrin and provides the appropriate coupling required for PMNs to transmit oxidant signals to endothelial cells. The oxidants augment NF-ÃƒÅ½Ã‚ÂºB signaling and TLR2 expression (+), which results in the augmented response of the cell to PGN, thereby amplifying ICAM-1 expression (circled +) and promoting stable adhesion of PMNs to endothelial cells and increased PMN migration.

In line with this, hepatocytes expressed mRNAs not only of the phagocyte gp91phox (Nox 2), but also of the homologs Nox 1 and 4 and Duox 1 and 2, as well as the regulatory subunit p47phox. gp91phox (Nox 2) and p47phox were also identified at the protein level in rat hepatocytes. CD95L induced within 1 min ceramide formation and serine phosphorylation of p47phox, which was sensitive to inhibitors of sphingomyelinase and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta). These inhibitors and p47phox protein knockdown inhibited the early CD95L-induced ROS response, suggesting that ceramide and PKCzeta are upstream events of the CD95L-induced Nox/Duox activation.

Single cell organisms are particularly dependent on mechanisms that permit adaptation to osmotic stress because each individual cell is directly exposed to the external environment. Mammals, however, limit osmotic stress by establishing an internal aqueous environment in which intravascular water and electrolytes are subject to sensitive and dynamic, organism-based homeostatic regulation. Recent studies of NFAT5/TonEBP, an essential mammalian osmoregulatory transcription factor, demonstrate the unexpected yet critical significance of cell-based osmotic regulation in vivo. These results highlight the fundamental importance of maintaining intracellular water homeostasis in the face of varying cellular metabolic activity and distinct tissue microenvironments.",

This ROS response was sensitive to inhibition by diphenyleneiodonium, apocynin, and neopterin, suggestive of an involvement of NADPH oxidases. In line with this, hepatocytes expressed mRNAs not only of the phagocyte gp91phox (Nox 2), but also of the homologs Nox 1 and 4 and Duox 1 and 2, as well as the regulatory subunit p47phox. gp91phox (Nox 2) and p47phox were also identified at the protein level in rat hepatocytes. CD95L induced within 1 min ceramide formation and serine phosphorylation of p47phox, which was sensitive to inhibitors of sphingomyelinase and protein kinase Czeta (PKCzeta). These inhibitors and p47phox protein knockdown inhibited the early CD95L-induced ROS response, suggesting that ceramide and PKCzeta are upstream events of the CD95L-induced Nox/Duox activation. CD95L also induced rapid activation of the Src family kinase Yes",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

We tested the effects of Ang II on Ang1, Ang2, or Tie2 expression in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells expressing the Ang II receptors AT(1) and AT(2). Ang II significantly induced Ang2 mRNA accumulations without affecting Ang1 or Tie2 expression, which was inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitors and by intracellular Ca(2+) chelating agents. Ang II transactivated EGFR via AT(1), and inhibition of EGFR abolished the induction of Ang2. Ang II caused processing of pro-HB-EGF in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner to stimulate maturation and release of HB-EGF. Neutralizing anti-HB-EGF antibody blocked EGFR phosphorylation by Ang II. Ang II also upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in an HB-EGF/EGFR-dependent manner. AT(2) inhibited AT(1)-mediated Ang2 expression and phosphorylation of EGFR. In an in vivo corneal assay, AT(1) induced angiogenesis in an HB-EGF-dependent manner and enhanced the angiogenic activity of VEGF. Although neither Ang2 nor Ang1 alone induced angiogenesis, soluble Tie2-Fc that binds to angiopoietins attenuated AT(1)-mediated angiogenesis. These findings suggested that (1) Ang II induces Ang2 and VEGF expression without affecting Ang1 or Tie2 and (2) AT(1) stimulates processing of pro-HB-EGF by metalloproteinases, and the released HB-EGF transactivates EGFR to induce angiogenesis via the combined effect of Ang2 and VEGF, whereas AT(2) attenuates them by blocking EGFR phosphorylation. Thus, Ang II is involved in the VEGF-Ang-Tie2 system via HB-EGF-mediated EGFR transactivation, and this link should be considerable in pathological conditions in which collateral blood flow is required.",

Recent studies suggest that decreased aquaporin 5 (AQP5) is correlated with increased staining of MUC5AC in submucosal glands of COPD patients. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the major insults in airway mucin secretion in COPD. In this study, changes in both AQP5 and MUC5AC expression levels in SPC-A1, a human airway submucosal gland cell line, were quantified after exposure of the cells to LPS. AQP5 transcription and protein expression were decreased while MUC5AC expression was increased by LPS exposure in SPC-A1 cells. Further studies revealed that AQP5 expression was down-regulated via the p38/JNK signaling pathway, while MUC5AC was up-regulated through the EGFR-p38/JNK pathway. Therefore, p38 and JNK may become promising targets to preserve AQP5 expression and prevent MUC5AC over-expression to restore proper H(2)O to mucin ratio of the airway mucus, which may be beneficial to the clinical management of COPD patients.",

In contrast, expression of CbpY317F or knockdown endogenous Cbp in NIH3T3 cells by RNA interference significantly enhanced EGF-induced activation of these enzymes and cell transformation. In addition, overexpression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)-induced Cbp tyrosine phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that Cbp functions as a negative regulator of cell transformation and tumor cell growth through downregulation of Src activation, suggesting that Cbp might be broadly involved in RTKs-activated signaling pathways and tumorigenesis.",

Cbp is located exclusively in so-called lipid rafts in which cholesterol, glycosphingolipid, and a variety of membrane-anchored signaling molecules including SFK accumulate. Lipid rafts are thus viewed as platforms for signaling across the membrane. The interaction of Cbp with Csk is also dependent upon the phosphorylation of its Tyr-314 by SFK (8-10). Based on these lines of evidence, a model of feedback regulation of SFK has been presented according to which activation of SFK by an extracellular stimulus leads to the phosphorylation of Cbp; this results in recruitment of Csk to lipid rafts and is followed by termination of SFK function (11-13).",

Holbro and N.E. Hynes, unpublished data). As a consequence, these cells have decreased PI-3K/PKB signaling, a reduction in D-type cyclin levels, and show an increase in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. A main effector of ErbB signaling, the PI-3K/PKB pathway, is particularly important in mediating cell survival 103 T. Holbro et al. / Experimental Cell Research 284 (2003) 99-110 since several PKB substrates directly control various apoptotic processes. The proapoptotic Bcl family member Bad, when phosphorylated by PKB [93], is retained in the cytosol where it is unable to inhibit survival proteins like Bcl-XL on the mitochondria [94]. In normal mammary cells, blocking ErbB1 activity leads to apoptosis by lowering phospho-Bad levels, [95], a characteristic that would be extremely desirable to retain in cancer cells. Another PKB target is caspase-9, whose activation is blocked by phosphorylation [96] Members of the forkhead family of transcription factors, when phosphorylated by PKB, are retained in the cytoplasm and are unable to stimulate expression of several critical genes for apoptosis, including FasL, BIM, and others (reviewed by Brunet et al. [97]). Moreover, PKB phosphorylates IKK-alpha, which in turn inactivates IkappaB, thus leading to activation of NF-kappaB. This transcription factor upregulates levels of the prosurvival Bcl-XL protein and several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) (reviewed by Datta et al. [98]). In this regard, it has been reported that cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 are resistant to TNF-induced apoptosis through a PKB/NF-B pathway [99]. Another ErbB effector protein, signal transducer, and activator of transcription (Stat) has been implicated in survival of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. ErbB1, activated as a result of autocrine TGF-alpha expression in tumor cells, constitutively activates Stat3 [100]. Blocking Stat3 in vivo is associated with decreased level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-XL and increased tumor cell death [101].",

AR exerted a mitogenic effect on LS-174 cells and partially mediated the PGE(2)-induced growth stimulation. In addition, PGE(2), in collaboration with transforming growth factor-alpha or K-Ras oncogene, synergistically induced AR expression and activated receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling pathways. Our results provide novel mechanisms for cyclooxygenase-2 pro-oncogenic activity and suggest that PGE(2) may act with major oncogenic pathways in a synergistic fashion to activate the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling system through a ligand-dependent autocrine pathway.",
