Studies with wild-type and mutant tail fusion constructs demonstrate that Src kinase phosphorylates tyrosine 354 in the Cyt2 isoform of the CD46 cytoplasmic tail. Consistent with these findings, infection studies show that PP2, a specific Src family kinase inhibitor, but not PP3, an inactive variant of this drug, reduces the ability of epithelial cells to support bacterial adhesion. Several lines of evidence point to the role of c-Yes, a member of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, in CD46 phosphorylation. GC infection causes c-Yes to aggregate in the host cell cortex beneath adherent bacteria, increases binding of c-Yes to CD46, and stimulates c-Yes kinase activity. Finally, c-Yes immunoprecipitated from epithelial cells is able to phosphorylate the wild-type Cyt2 tail but not the mutant derivative in which tyrosine 354 has been substituted with alanine. We conclude that GC infection leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD46 Cyt2 tail and that the Src kinase c-Yes is involved in this reaction",

Chemokine receptors mediate agonist-dependent cell responses, including migration and activation of several signaling pathways. In the present study we show that several human melanoma cell lines and melanoma cells on macroscopically infiltrated lymph nodes express the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4. Using the highly invasive melanoma cell line BLM, we demonstrate that the chemokine Mig, a ligand for CXCR3, activates the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, induces a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and triggers cell chemotaxis and modulation of integrin VLA-5- and VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin. Furthermore, the chemokine SDF-1alpha, the ligand of CXCR4, triggered modulation of beta(1) integrin-dependent melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin. Additionally, Mig and SDF-1alpha activated MAPKs p44/42 and p38 on melanoma cells. Expression of functional CXCR3 and CXCR4 receptors on melanoma cells indicates that they might contribute to cell motility during invasion as well as to regulation of cell proliferation and survival.",

Here we show that Nischarin also interacts with members of the PAK family of kinases. The amino terminus of Nischarin preferentially binds to the carboxy-terminal domain of PAK1 when the kinase is in its activated conformation. Nischarin binding to PAK1 is enhanced by active Rac, with the three proteins forming a complex, while expression of the alpha5beta1 integrin also increases the Nischarin/PAK1 association. Interaction with Nischarin strongly inhibits the ability of PAK1 to phosphorylate substrates. This effect on PAK kinase activity closely parallels Nischarin's ability to inhibit cell migration.",

Therefore, we sought concento determine if still other integrins implicated in angio- genesis, a5b1, a fibronectin receptor (Bloch et al., 1997), and a2b1, a collagen receptor (Senger et al., 1997), might be activated by VEGF165. In cell migration assays, VEGF165 markedly stimulated HUVEC movement onto effibronectin (see Figure 3A). The migrating cells exhibited extensive spreading, much more so than for their aVb3- mediated migration onto vitronectin (see Figure 2A). shown in Figure 3B, VEGF165-enhanced migration was only partly dependent upon aVb3 activation (partial inhi- bition by c7E3) and partly dependent upon a5b1; mAb JBS5 to a5b1 produced marked inhibition. The combina- tion of mAbs c7E3 and JBS5 produced full inhibition cell migration. Thus, integrin a5b1 also can be activated tranwhen HUVECs are stimulated with VEGF165. A similar conclusion was reached with regard to VEGF165 activa- tion of integrin a2b1 using Type I collagen as a matrix (Figure 3C). The role of a2b1 in this migration was con- firmed using blocking mAb BHA2.1. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the VEGF165 can acti- vate the major integrins, aVb3, aVb5, a5b1, and a2b1, implicated in angiogenesis.",

Nischarin binding to PAK1 is enhanced by active Rac, with the three proteins forming a complex, while expression of the alpha5beta1 integrin also increases the Nischarin/PAK1 association. Interaction with Nischarin strongly inhibits the ability of PAK1 to phosphorylate substrates. This effect on PAK kinase activity closely parallels Nischarin's ability to inhibit cell migration.",

Therefore, we sought concento determine if still other integrins implicated in angio- genesis, a5b1, a fibronectin receptor (Bloch et al., 1997), and a2b1, a collagen receptor (Senger et al., 1997), might be activated by VEGF165. In cell migration assays, VEGF165 markedly stimulated HUVEC movement onto effibronectin (see Figure 3A). The migrating cells exhibited extensive spreading, much more so than for their aVb3- mediated migration onto vitronectin (see Figure 2A). shown in Figure 3B, VEGF165-enhanced migration was only partly dependent upon aVb3 activation (partial inhi- bition by c7E3) and partly dependent upon a5b1; mAb JBS5 to a5b1 produced marked inhibition. The combina- tion of mAbs c7E3 and JBS5 produced full inhibition cell migration. Thus, integrin a5b1 also can be activated tranwhen HUVECs are stimulated with VEGF165. A similar conclusion was reached with regard to VEGF165 activa- tion of integrin a2b1 using Type I collagen as a matrix (Figure 3C). The role of a2b1 in this migration was con- firmed using blocking mAb BHA2.1. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the VEGF165 can acti- vate the major integrins, aVb3, aVb5, a5b1, and a2b1, implicated in angiogenesis.",

Chemokine receptors mediate agonist-dependent cell responses, including migration and activation of several signaling pathways. In the present study we show that several human melanoma cell lines and melanoma cells on macroscopically infiltrated lymph nodes express the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4. Using the highly invasive melanoma cell line BLM, we demonstrate that the chemokine Mig, a ligand for CXCR3, activates the small GTPases RhoA and Rac1, induces a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and triggers cell chemotaxis and modulation of integrin VLA-5- and VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion to fibronectin. Furthermore, the chemokine SDF-1alpha, the ligand of CXCR4, triggered modulation of beta(1) integrin-dependent melanoma cell adhesion to fibronectin. Additionally, Mig and SDF-1alpha activated MAPKs p44/42 and p38 on melanoma cells. Expression of functional CXCR3 and CXCR4 receptors on melanoma cells indicates that they might contribute to cell motility during invasion as well as to regulation of cell proliferation and survival.",

Cbp is located exclusively in so-called lipid rafts in which cholesterol, glycosphingolipid, and a variety of membrane-anchored signaling molecules including SFK accumulate. Lipid rafts are thus viewed as platforms for signaling across the membrane. The interaction of Cbp with Csk is also dependent upon the phosphorylation of its Tyr-314 by SFK (8-10). Based on these lines of evidence, a model of feedback regulation of SFK has been presented according to which activation of SFK by an extracellular stimulus leads to the phosphorylation of Cbp; this results in recruitment of Csk to lipid rafts and is followed by termination of SFK function (11-13).",

As Src-family kinases activate the PI 3-kinase pathway in many cells [1], it is possible that the overexpression of Src, Lyn or Lck in HEK-293 cells induces the activation of PI 3-kinase, thereby promoting DAPP1 phosphorylation in unstimulated cells. As Src-family tyrosine kinases are located at the plasma membrane by virtue of myristoylation and palmitoylation of their N-termini [26], it is likely that the role of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is to recruit DAPP1 to the cell membrane, where it can be phosphorylated with Src-family tyrosine kinases.",

Altogether these results are consistent with the idea that the beta-catenin/TCF4 transactivation pathway contributes to SMC3 overexpression in intestinal tumorigenesis.",

The DNA-ß-catenin/Tcf-4 complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies shown in Fig. 2C followed by reversal of cross-linking and PCR amplification using primers flanking the TBE1 (?3.8 kb) and TBE2 (?6.1 kb) and nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B)/signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1; ?5.8 to ?5.2 kb) sites in the NOS2 promoter (Fig. 2C). Agarose gel analysis of PCR products showed that the TBE1 or TBE2 containing DNA was immunoprecipitated by anti-ß-catenin (Fig. 2C, lane B) or anti-Tcf-4 (Fig. 2C, lane T) antibodies, and only a weak background was observed by IgG (Fig. 2C, lane I). These evidences indicate that ß-catenin/Tcf-4 specifically binds to the NOS2 promoter TBE1 and TBE2 regions in vivo. Overexpression of beta-catenin and Tcf-4 significantly increased both basal and cytokine-induced NOS2 promoter activity (P < 0.01), and the induction was dependent on intact TBE sites. Transfection with control Tcf-4 (Fig. 4A, lane 1) or ß-catenin (Fig. 4A, lane 2) empty vectors did not induce NOS2 mRNA or protein, whereas induction of both endogenous mRNA and protein was observed with overexpression of Tcf-4 (Fig. 4A, lane 3) or ß-catenin (Fig. 4A, lane 4).

A critical serine phosphorylation site at amino acid 37 that ordinarily targets ß-catenin for degradation has been mutated (10) . Fig. 1D.  Citation  illustrates a linear dose response to the effects of ß-cateninS37A. The peak response was observed when 1.25 µg of expression vector was cotransfected with 0.75 µg of reporter vector, resulting in a >30-fold stimulation of VEGF promoter activity. In independent studies, HeLa cells were treated with 25 mM LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK-3ß kinase activity. GSK-3ß is a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, and inhibiting GSK-3ß with LiCl resulted in a 2.2-fold increase in VEGF promoter activity. Collectively, these findings indicate that activation of Wnt signaling up-regulates VEGF expression in colonic neoplasia. (from full text) ",

Dkk3 is the only Dkk family member abundantly expressed in normal lung, but silenced by promoter hypermethylation in a large fraction of lung cancer cell lines and lung tumors. Downregulation of Dkk3 was correlated with tumor progression and expression of nuclear beta-catenin in lung tumors. Ectopic expression of Dkk3 in lung cancer cells with Dkk3 hypermethylation induced apoptosis and inhibited TCF-4 activity as well as nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and expression of TCF-4 targets c-Myc and cyclin D1. Furthermore, small interference RNA knock down of Dkk3 in cells lacking Dkk3 hypermethylation was sufficient to promote cell proliferation, beta-catenin nuclear translocation and expression of c-Myc. These observations suggested that epigenetic inactivation of Dkk3 activates the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, thereby promoting the growth of lung cancer cells.",

Taken together, these findings have demonstrated that the uPAR localized cell surface proteolysis plays an important role in tubular angiogenesis. Targeting the uPA-uPAR system may be useful to affect these early events in angiogenesis. This viewpoint is in accordance with the finding that angiogenesis occurring in certain tumors in vivo can be reduced by administration of a catalytically inactive uPA, which retains receptor binding and thus competes for binding of native uPA [168].  The expression of urokinase and its receptor have been shown immunohistochemically in endothelial cells involved in formation of tubules in fibrin matrices [167]. The fact that a few cells in the unstimulated monolayer are positive for uPAR may reflect the existence of a subpopulation of cells that are more able to invade the fibrin matrix if adequate stimuli, which induce uPA expression are provided [169]. Beside a function in controling of spatially focalized degradation of the basement membrane, uPA bound to uPAR influences angiogenesis also by the activation of intracellular signal systems in endothelial cells. Thus, it activates MAP-kinases and the phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins [170]. Analysis by immunoblotting demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), the focal adhesion-associated proteins paxillin and p130cas, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) following the occupancy of the uPAR by uPA.",

Also from full text... Activation of FAK is largely accomplished via its phosphorylation. The initial activation step is autophosphorylation at tyrosine 397 which becomes a site for binding the oncogene Src and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase kinase through their SH2 domains [9]. Subsequently, Y576 and Y577 in the kinase loop are phosphorylated which increases FAK’s catalytic activity. Phosphorylation of Y925 produces a binding site for the SH2 domain of the adapter protein Grb2 which then assembles a signaling complex including Ras and Sos, and ultimately activates the ERK pathway [9].",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

              "summary_text": "MyD88 also interacts directly with AKT, and a dominant-negative mutant of AKT causes a defect in MyD88-dependent NF-kB transcriptional activity. However, the binding of NF-kB to DNA is not affected by inhibiting AKT, indicating that AKT might be involved in the phosphorylation of the p65 transactivation domain. A dominant-negative mutant of MyD88 was shown to block the kinase activity of AKT generated in response to LPS and IL-1, and a dominant-negative mutant of p85 inhibited the NF-kB activity elicited by LPS and IL-1 but not that elicited by TNF85. These findings indicate that PI3K is a positive mediator of the signalling induced by LPS and IL-1 that leads to NF-kB activation. However, recent studies using mice that lack the p85 regulatory subunit showed an increased production of IL-12 by DCs, possibly because of enhanced activation of the p38 MAPK, indicating that PI3K might have a negative role in TLR signalling in DCs86.  ECSIT. ECSIT has no homology with any known protein and was cloned as a TRAF6-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening87. ECSIT interacts with the conserved TRAF domain of TRAF6. A Drosophila homologue of ECSIT has been identified, and the interaction between TRAF6 and ECSIT is also conserved in Drosophila. ECSIT also interacts with MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase kinase 1), which can phosphorylate and activate the IKK complex. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ECSIT blocks signalling through TLR4, indicating that ECSIT might transduce TLR signals by bridging TRAF6 and the IKK complex. Furthermore, the inhibition of ECSIT expression, using siRNA in a macrophage cell line, resulted in impaired LPS-induced, but not TNF-induced, NF-kB activation88. The physiological function of ECSIT was studied by generating ECSIT-deficient mice, which were found to die on about embryonic day 7.5 (Ref. 88). Further characterization showed that ECSIT is an obligatory intermediate in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, and therefore ECSIT is an essential component in both the TLR- and BMP-signalling pathways.  SRC family of tyrosine kinases. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the SRC-related TEC-family of protein tyrosine kinases and has an essential role in B-cell development and B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signalling. Macrophages from X-linked-immunodeficient mice that lack BTK show reduced responses to LPS, and BTK has also been found to associate with the TIR domain of TLR4,TLR6, TLR8 and TLR9 (Ref. 89). It has also been shown to associate with MyD88, TIRAP and IRAK1, and to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to LPS, whereas a dominant-negative form of BTK inhibits LPS-induced activation of NF-kB, indicating that BTK is involved in the TLR-mediated signalling pathway. During BCR-mediated signalling, BTK interacts with and is activated by the SRC family of tyrosine kinases, such as FYN, LYN and haematopoietic-cell kinase, HCK; however, SRC-family kinases have only a minor role in LPS signalling90. Therefore, the involvement of BTK in TLR signalling needs to be further investigated.  MAPKKK. Members of the MAPKKK family - such as TAK1, MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, TPL2 (tumour-progression locus 2; also known as cancer Osaka thyroid, COT) and NIK - are implicated in IKK-NF-kB and MAPK activation. Among these members, MEKK3 has been shown to be involved in signalling through TLR4 but not through TLR9 (Ref. 91): in response to stimulation with a TLR4 ligand but not a TLR9 ligand, embryonic fibroblasts from MEKK3-deficient mice were shown to have impaired IL-6 production and defective activation of NF-kB, JNK and the p38 MAPK. Stimulation of TLR4 also induced association of MEKK3 with TRAF6. So, MEKK3 is involved in the TLR4-mediated signalling pathway. Another member of the MKKK family, TPL2 has been shown to be involved in the TLR4-mediated activation of ERK92. In response to TLR4 ligand, TPL2-deficient...",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

Phenylalanine mutations at these three tyrosines results in a receptor that fails to constitutively activate the Erk pathway but retains the ability to induce Erk phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation. The ability of mRon to activate the MAP kinase pathway is dependent on c-Src activity, and we have shown that c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with mRon. c-Src fails to interact with mRon when the three tyrosines required for MAP kinase activation are mutated, whereas the presence of any one of these tyrosines alone restores Erk phosphorylation and recruitment of c-Src.",

Because PAR-1 has no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, yet requires tyrosine phosphorylation events to induce mitogenesis, we investigated the role of the Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs) in thrombin-mediated signaling. JAK2 was activated rapidly in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) treated with thrombin, and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1 and STAT3) were phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in a JAK2-dependent manner. AG-490, a JAK2-specific inhibitor, and a dominant negative JAK2 mutant inhibited thrombin-induced ERK2 activity and VSMC proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. To elucidate the functional significance of JAK-STAT activation, we studied the effect of thrombin on heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, based upon the following: 1) reports that thrombin stimulates reactive oxygen species production in VSMC; 2) the putative role of Hsps in modulating cellular responses to reactive oxygen species; and 3) the presence of functional STAT1/3-binding sites in Hsp70 and Hsp90beta promoters. Indeed, thrombin up-regulated Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein expression via enhanced binding of STATs to cognate binding sites in the Hsp70 and Hsp90 promoters. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT pathway activation is necessary for thrombin-induced VSMC growth and Hsp gene expression.",

Recently, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been shown to be implicated in the cellular response to activated ras. Purified MAP kinases specifically phosphorylated Thr-235 of NF-IL6 in vitro. Mutation of Thr-235 abolished the ras-dependent activation of NF-IL6.

              "summary_text": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a central pathway that transmits signals from many extracellular agents to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle progression. The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Understanding of these processes may provide a full picture of the distinct, and even opposing cellular processes that are regulated by the ERK cascade.",

The CDFs leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) bind to a LIFR.gp130 receptor complex to activate Jak/signal transducers and activators of transcription and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways. Little is known about how these differentiation factors suppress noradrenergic properties. We used sympathetic neurons and SK-N-BE(2)M17 neuroblastoma cells to investigate CDF down-regulation of the norepinephrine synthetic enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). LIF and CNTF activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2 but not p38 or Jun N-terminal kinases in both cell types. Preventing ERK activation with PD98059 blocked CNTF suppression of DBH protein in sympathetic neurons but did not prevent the loss of DBH mRNA. CNTF decreased transcription of a DBH promoter-luciferase reporter construct in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and this was also ERK-independent. Cytokine inhibition of DBH promoter activity did not require a silencer element but was prevented by overexpression of the transcriptional activator Phox2a. Inhibiting ERK activation increased basal DBH transcription in SK-N-BE(2)M17 cells, and DBH mRNA in sympathetic neurons. Transfection of Phox2a into PD98059-treated M17 cells resulted in a synergistic increase in DBH promoter activity compared with Phox2a or PD98059 alone. These data suggest that CDFs down-regulate DBH protein via an ERK-dependent pathway but inhibit DBH gene expression through an ERK-independent pathway. They further suggest that ERK activity inhibits basal DBH gene expression.",

Furthermore, a positive feedback loop between TOPK and ERK2 was identified. With epidermal growth factor treatment, knockdown of either TOPK or ERK2 in HCT116 cells resulted in a decreased phosphorylation of ERK2 or TOPK, respectively, and knockdown of TOPK in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells blocked the phosphorylation of downstream substrates of ERK2. CONCLUSIONS: The positive feedback loop between TOPK and ERK2 increases tumorigenesis properties of HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, and TOPK-regulated signaling may serve as a potential therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.",

Conversely, inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinases by the pyrazolopyrimidine PP2, as in kinase-inactive Hck mutants, significantly reduces IL-6-triggered activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AKT-1, leading to significant reduction of multiple myeloma cell proliferation and survival. Taken together, these results delineate a key role for Hck-mediated phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab2 docking proteins in IL-6-induced proliferation and survival of multiple myeloma cells and identify tyrosine kinases and downstream adapter proteins as potential new therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185].

The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Raised p53 levels can either impose growth arrest, typically by inducing the Waf1 cell-cycle inhibitor, or promote apoptosis through targets such as Bax, Puma and Noxa. The apoptotic targets seem to also require the p53 relative p63 or p73 (REF. 152). Circles/ovals denote oncogene products; rectangles denote known or likely tumour suppressors.

Recently, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases have been shown to be implicated in the cellular response to activated ras. Purified MAP kinases specifically phosphorylated Thr-235 of NF-IL6 in vitro. Mutation of Thr-235 abolished the ras-dependent activation of NF-IL6.

              "summary_text": "Also, antioxidants decrease the mRNA abundance of MSR-1 by suppressing NF-kB and decreasing MSR-1 mRNA stability rather than through direct effects on transcription [102]. A summary of redox effects on various transcription factors as well as on some elements of signal transduction pathways is presented in Table 1. Although Table 1 presents an overview of the effects as well as the differences that may occur between different cell models, a comprehensive presentation of all redox effects on these factors and their interactions is far beyond the scope of the present discussion. For more detailed discussions of some of the effects listed in Table 1, the reader is referred to several excellent reviews [14-17,93,103-105]. Also, we have primarily focused on oxygen-centered species rather than on reactive nitrogen species; for a review of nitrogen intermediates in signal transduction, the reader is referred to the article by Lander [90]. SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS Although many pathways are known to be redoxsensitive, none have been more thoroughly examined than the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways. Many of the redox effects on cells are mediated either directly or indirectly through these pathways, which contain multiple steps sensitive to ROS. Because of the large number of studies of oxidants on the various components of the MAP kinase and NF-kB signal transduction pathways, we provide a brief overview of both these pathways. MAP kinases Extracellular signaling molecules such as growth factors and cytokines induce changes in cell behavior via complex mechanisms that involve transmission of the signal from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, where gene expression is altered [303,304]. The first step of a signaling cascade usually involves the activation of receptors that either have protein kinase activity or activate protein kinases in the cytoplasm. The signal is eventually transmitted to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription factors that regulate gene expression. One of the most studied families of signal transduction pathways is the (MAP) kinase family (Fig. 1). Four MAP kinase subfamilies have been identified to date: (i) ERK [305- 309], (ii) JNK/SAP kinase [310-314], (iii) p38 kinases, [315-318], and (iv) big MAP kinase (BMK/ERK5) [319, 320]. All these pathways contain redox-sensitive sites (Table 1). In the ERK and JNK pathways, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor such as the mammalian homologue of Sos [321] activates Ras by conversion of Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP [322-324]. Sos must usually complex with other proteins to perform this function. It contains SH2 domains, which are a conserved sequence of 100 amino acids that bind to tyrosine phosphorylated motifs in other proteins [17]. In the cytoplasm, Sos is constitutively bound to another SH2 domain-containing protein, Grb-2 [325-327]. Activation of growth factor receptors results in tyrosine autophosphorylation and recruitment of SH2 domain-containing affectors, including Grb-2 [325,328-330]. The result is plasma membrane targeting of Sos [331], where it is tyrosinephosphorylated [332] (Fig. 1). The phosphorylated Grb-2/Sos complex binds to an adapter protein, the SH-containing (SHC) protein [330, 333-336], and the multiprotein complex activates Ras-GDP by converting it to its GTP-bound form [337]. Interestingly, treatment of cells with oxidants such as H2O2 stimulates formation of the SHC-Grb2-Sos complex [99].",

Supportive of the importance of NF-kappaB in transformation, Ras-induced cellular transformation can be suppressed by expression of IkappaBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, or by dominant-negative forms of the upstream activator IkappaB kinase (IKK). However, conclusive evidence for a requirement for NF-kappaB subunits in oncogenic transformation has not been reported. Furthermore, there is little understanding of the gene targets controlled by NF-kappaB that might support oncogenic conversion. The data presented here demonstrate that, although both p65 and c-Rel enhance the frequency of Ras-induced cellular transformation, these NF-kappaB subunits are not essential for Ras to transform spontaneously immortalized murine fibroblasts. Microarray analysis identified a set of genes induced by Ras that is dependent on NF-kappaB for their expression and that likely play contributory roles in promoting Ras-induced oncogenic transformation.",

Hs766T cells express activated KRAS and display elevated levels of pERK1/2 and pAKT (Fig. 4C). Treatment of Hs766T cells with the PI3'-kinase inhibitor LY294002 led to a selective decrease in pAKT with little or no effect on pERK1/2. By contrast, treatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or CI-1040 led to a selective decrease in pERK1/2 with little or no effect on pAKT. Strikingly, both the PI3'-kinase and the MEK inhibitors led to accumulation of p27Kip1 expression. These data are consistent with the observation that both MEK and PI3'-kinase inhibitors elicited a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in Hs766T cells (data not shown). Further consistent with these observations, treatment of a panel of pancreatic cancer cells (eight cell lines) (57) with a MEK inhibitor (U0126 or CI-1040) led to a consistent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest accompanied by induced expression of p27Kip1 in all eight cell lines tested (S. Gysin and M. McMahon, sub- mitted for publication). For the most part, treatment of cells with MEK inhibitors led to a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic effect, although cell death was often observed after prolonged treatment (+6 days). Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with LY294002 led in some cases to a cytostatic effect and in others to a more rapid cytotoxic effect. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 4C, inhibition of PI3'-kinase by LY294002 led to elevated p27Kip1 expression in five of eight pancreas cancer cell lines tested. These data are fully consistent with the hypothesis that the RAS-activated RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3'-kinase- PDK-AKT pathways play a role in the regulation of p27Kip1 expression in bona fide human cancer cell lines.",

Grb2 may bind Kit either directly or indirectly through interaction with Shc or SHP2. Since Grb2 is constitutively associated with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, the recruitment of Grb2 to the activated Kit resultes in the colocalization of Sos and Ras and the subsequent activation of Ras. This promotes the interaction of Ras with Raf serinethreonine kinase and then the activation of MEK (a MAP kinase kinase). MEK phosphorylates ERK (a MAP kinase), and ERK phosphorylates a number of substrates, including pp90rsk [33]. Imatinib mesylate also inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK [34]. This process is considered to be due to blocking of the Kit signaling by this drug. Thus, both major signaling pathways of Kit, the PI3K/Akt system and the Ras/MAP kinase cascade, are inhibited by imatinib mesylate.",

Mutagenesis of BCR Tyr-177 to Phe completely abolished FES-induced BCR binding to the GRB2 SH2 domain, identifying Tyr-177 as an additional phosphorylation site for FES.",

              "summary_text": "Raf may also be activated by Ras-independent elements and, in turn, propagates signals through diverse effectors that mediate proliferation, angiogenesis, metastases, and survival.5 Raf may be activated by signaling upstream or constitutively. Constitutive activation of Raf and Ras are indistinguishable in their potential to induce malignant transformation.6-8 Activating raf mutations have been identified in melanoma, thyroid, colon, and other cancers (Table 1).9-43 Furthermore, the disappointing clinical results of farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitors (FTIs) that were developed based on a flawed premise that they would effectively target malignancies with a high incidence of Ras mutation has led to scrutiny of signaling elements downstream of Ras, such as Raf, as therapeutic targets.44 This review highlights relevant information about the biology of Raf and novel strategies directed at exploiting this knowledge to more effectively treat malignant diseases. SIGNALING THROUGH THE MAPK PATHWAY The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival are receiving considerable attention as potential targets for anticancer strategies. 45,46 Recently, there has been a notable increase in efforts directed at targeting the MAPK pathway, which integrates a wide array of proliferative signals initiated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein- coupled receptors.47,48 The network of signals emanating from the MAPK pathway are transmitted by proteins that serve as chemical switches, cycling between phosphorylated (activated) and dephosphorylated (inactivated) states.49 These on and off switches are regulated by kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Activated signaling elements, in turn, phosphorylate amino acid residues on downstream signaling proteins in a cascade-like and expansive manner.50 Not only does the centrality of the MAPK pathway render its components important targets for therapeutic development, but many genes that encode for its critical signaling elements undergo mutations, constitutively activating downstream signaling elements and conferring the potential for transformation and autonomous growth.50-52 In addition to efforts directed at Ras, therapeutic strategies directed at the MAPK pathway are targeting the cascade of downstream effector proteins including Raf, MAPK kinase (MAPKK; also called MEK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK] kinase), and ERK. The Raf/MEK/ERK module (Fig 1) of the MAPK pathway, which is immediately downstream of Ras, may be less redundant and innately resistant to therapeutic manipulations compared with Ras (as discussed in the next section). The Unfilled Promise of Targeting Ras The Raf/MEK/ERK module of the MAPK pathway has been the focus of considerable attention because therapeutic efforts directed at Ras, which is situated at the apex of the MAPK pathway, have been disappointing.44 Ras belongs to a superfamily of guanine nucleotide triphosphatases (GTPases) that transmit proliferative and survival signals to the MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and other pathways (Figs 1 and 2). Three ras proto-oncogenes encode four 21-kd proteins, called p21ras or Ras (H-Ras, N-Ras, K-Ras4A, and K-Ras4B, resulting from two alternatively spliced K-Ras gene products), that are localized to the inner surface of the cell membrane.44 Of the three ras genes, K-ras mutations are most commonly found in solid malignancies, whereas N-ras mutations are encountered less often, and H-ras mutations are rarely encountered.53,54 Ras isoforms impart distinct biologic effects as a result of the potential of these proteins to differentially activitate critical effectors.55 After synthesis as inactive cytosolic propeptides, Ras undergoes a series of post-translational modifications at its carboxyl terminus that increase its hydrophobicity.56,57 These modifications render Ras functional and capable of lo...",

Akt promotes survival, at least in part, by phosphorylating and thereby inactivating two proapoptotic proteins, Bad and caspase-9 (53) (Fig. 4). Inhibition of p53 prevents FAKdeficient cells from undergoing anoikis when deprived of growth factors, suggesting that p53 mediates the death signal under FAK deficiency (51).",

NF-?B is a critical transcription factor in the production of proangiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines such as VEGF, IL-8. Decreased production of these factors would be expected to inhibit recruitment of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, and block tumor angiogenesis. PPAR?-mediated suppression of members of the Snail family of transcription factors, such as Snail, Zeb, or Twist, would lead to derepression of E-cadherin expression and promote the epithelial phenotype, leading to decreased migration and invasiveness. PPAR?-mediated suppression of COX-2 expression in NSCLC has been shown by several investigators. This would result in decreased PGE2 production, which will impact growth.

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

Increase of the phosphorylation of S6 as well as 4E-BP1 was observed 30,31,33. In contrast, Rheb did not stimulate Akt phosphorylation 30,33]. The increase of S6K activity by the transient expression of Rheb was inhibited by the addition of rapamycin but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K This led to the activation of S6K as detected by its phosphorylation. However, expression of dominant negative Rheb mutant, Rheb1D60K, blocked serum-inducted activation of S6K The overall picture of the involvement of Rheb in the insulin mTOR S6K signaling pathway is shown in Fig. 3. During serum activation of this signaling pathway, insulin or IGF1 is received by their respective receptors at the cell surface. This results in the activation of PI3K, which then phosphorylates Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates Tsc2 and inhibits the ability of Tsc1 Tsc2 to negatively regulate mTOR. The inhibition of Tsc1 Tsc2 leads to the activation of Rheb, which then causes activation of mTOR. At least two downstream events, activation of p70S6K and phosphorylation of S6, as well as phosphorylation of 4E BP1 contribute to the increase in protein synthesis and progression of cell cycle49.",

For example, integrin- airlinked kinase (ILK) activation is inhibited by blockade of Akt function (Persad et al., 2000), and PTEN interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and influences cell migration (Tamura et al., 1999). These interactions affect cell survival, an event influenced by both VEGF and integrins. Also, cell migration and angiogenesis are reg- ulated by Akt and PTEN, and these cellular responses are clearly mediated by integrins (Jiang et al., 2000). By overexpression approaches, we have directly impli- cated Akt and PTEN in the pathway from VEGF to integ- rin activation. Thus, some of the functions of PI 3-kinase, Akt, and PTEN in cell migration may depend upon their role in integrin activation, and engagement of VEGFR2",

              "summary_text": "Interestingly, the presence of two additional basic amino acids 6 and 7 residues N-terminal to the phosphorylation site in certain peptide substrates allows phosphorylation by CaMKI/IV equally well with or without activation by a CaMKK (14). This \\\"activation independence\\\" has not yet been demonstrated toward protein substrates. Nonetheless, because CaMKI/IV requires Ca2+/CaM for deinhibition in addition to activation loop phosphorylation, substrates of this type would not be phosphorylated by CaMKI/IV until a Ca2+ signal was initiated and so could represent Ca2+-dependent but activation-independent signaling targets. Subsequent activation by a CaMKK would increase the number of available substrates by enhancing CaMKI/IV activity toward a second set of substrates (Fig. 1).   Does the Cascade Function in Cells? TOP INTRODUCTION Identification and Biochemical... Does the Cascade Function... Is the Cascade Physiologic? Other Transcriptional Targets... Evidence for a CaMK... REFERENCES  The first reconstruction of a CaMK cascade in cells used transient transfection experiments with CREB as the transcriptional target. CaMKI and CaMKIV phosphorylate CREB on its activating Ser-133 in vitro and stimulate Gal4-CREB-dependent transcription in response to a rise in intracellular Ca2+ when cells are cotransfected with Gal4-CREB and a Gal4 reporter gene (15). Additional cotransfection with a CaMKK increases reporter activity more than 10-fold (8, 9). Mutation of the CaMKIV activation loop T to A abolishes CaMKK enhancement.  To be a signaling cascade, kinase activation loop phosphorylation must be dependent upon induction of CaMKK activity. Phosphate incorporation into endogenous CaMKIV in Jurkat cells is induced rapidly following T-cell receptor stimulation and is blocked by chelation of extracellular Ca2+. This is accompanied by 8-14-fold increases in immunoprecipitated CaMKIV activity that is refractory to further activation by exogenous CaMKK and can be reversed by in vitro treatment with PP2A (16). Recombinant CaMKIV transfected into BJAB cells, which lack endogenous CaMKIV, demonstrates similar activation following anti-IgM stimulation that is abrogated by mutating the activation loop T to A (4). Likewise, CaMKI phosphorylation is induced in PC12 cells, coincident with increased CaMKI activity and reduced activation of CaMKI by exogenous CaMKK (17). Collectively, these experiments provide strong evidence for an inducible, Ca2+-dependent activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV in intact cells via activation loop phosphorylation. However, the fact that activation loop phosphorylation requires Ca2+ does not confirm that the physiologic activator is itself Ca2+-dependent, because Ca2+/CaM binding to CaMKI or CaMKIV is required before these enzymes can be phosphorylated by the known CaMKKs.  The issue of subcellular localization is a confounding one for any model of the CaMK cascade regulating transcription. There are several lines of evidence that CaMKK and - are both cytoplasmic. In contrast to an early study using a polyclonal antibody, immunohistochemistry of rat brain slices using monoclonal antibodies able to distinguish between the  and  isoforms found exclusively cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for both (18). Furthermore, green fluorescent protein-tagged CaMKK and - are cytoplasmic in NG108 cells even after depolarizing stimulation (18). This holds true for overexpressed CaMKK in Jurkat and BJAB cells.2 Similarly, CaMKI appears to be excluded from the nucleus in brain slices as well as in cells overexpressing the protein, yet CaMKI immunoreactivity has recently been observed to translocate to the nuclei of hippocampal neurons during long term potentiation (19, 20).3 In contrast, CaMKIV is predominantly nuclear but can also be found in neuronal soma and dendritic processes, where it could interact with a cytoplasmic CaMKK (21).  The CaMK cascade then is well positioned to affect cytoplasmic e...",

Our data support a model where the chromatin architecture of the ITGB8 core promoter is altered by nucleosomal repositioning that enhances the interaction of an AP1 complex (containing c-Jun and ATF2). This repositioning is caused by the dissociation of HDAC2 with the ITGB8 core promoter, leading to increased histone H4 acetylation and a loosening of nucleosomal-DNA interactions allowing \\\"opening\\\" of the chromatin structure and increased association of c-Jun and ATF-2. These changes are mediated through NFkB- and p38-dependent pathways. Ultimately, these events culminate in increasing ITGB8 transcription, avb8 surface expression, and avb8-mediated TGFb activation",

For example, integrin- airlinked kinase (ILK) activation is inhibited by blockade of Akt function (Persad et al., 2000), and PTEN interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and influences cell migration (Tamura et al., 1999). These interactions affect cell survival, an event influenced by both VEGF and integrins. Also, cell migration and angiogenesis are reg- ulated by Akt and PTEN, and these cellular responses are clearly mediated by integrins (Jiang et al., 2000). By overexpression approaches, we have directly impli- cated Akt and PTEN in the pathway from VEGF to integ- rin activation. Thus, some of the functions of PI 3-kinase, Akt, and PTEN in cell migration may depend upon their role in integrin activation, and engagement of VEGFR2",

Using a combination of biochemical and mutational analyses, we demonstrate that EGF induces the phosphorylation of three specific serine residues (S(1356), S(1360), and S(1364)) located within the connecting segment of the beta 4 subunit and that phosphorylation on these residues accounts for the bulk of beta 4 phosphorylation stimulated by EGF.",

Therefore, we sought concento determine if still other integrins implicated in angio- genesis, a5b1, a fibronectin receptor (Bloch et al., 1997), and a2b1, a collagen receptor (Senger et al., 1997), might be activated by VEGF165. In cell migration assays, VEGF165 markedly stimulated HUVEC movement onto effibronectin (see Figure 3A). The migrating cells exhibited extensive spreading, much more so than for their aVb3- mediated migration onto vitronectin (see Figure 2A). shown in Figure 3B, VEGF165-enhanced migration was only partly dependent upon aVb3 activation (partial inhi- bition by c7E3) and partly dependent upon a5b1; mAb JBS5 to a5b1 produced marked inhibition. The combina- tion of mAbs c7E3 and JBS5 produced full inhibition cell migration. Thus, integrin a5b1 also can be activated tranwhen HUVECs are stimulated with VEGF165. A similar conclusion was reached with regard to VEGF165 activa- tion of integrin a2b1 using Type I collagen as a matrix (Figure 3C). The role of a2b1 in this migration was con- firmed using blocking mAb BHA2.1. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the VEGF165 can acti- vate the major integrins, aVb3, aVb5, a5b1, and a2b1, implicated in angiogenesis.",

              "summary_text": "Platelets perform a central role in haemostasis and thrombosis. They adhere to subendothelial collagens exposed at sites of blood vessel injury via the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX receptor complex, GPVI and integrin alpha(2)beta(1). These receptors perform distinct functions in the regulation of cell signalling involving non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. Src, Fyn, Lyn, Syk and Btk), adaptor proteins, phospholipase C and lipid kinases such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase. They are also coupled to an increase in cytosolic calcium levels and protein kinase C activation, leading to the secretion of paracrine/autocrine platelet factors and an increase in integrin receptor affinities. Through the binding of plasma fibrinogen and von Willebrand Factor to integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3), a platelet thrombus is formed. Although increasing evidence indicates that each of the adhesion receptors GPIb-V-IX and GPVI and integrins alpha(2)beta(1) and alpha(IIb)beta(3) contribute to the signalling that regulates this process, the individual roles of each are only beginning to be dissected. By contrast, adhesion receptor signalling through platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) is implicated in the inhibition of platelet function and thrombus formation in the healthy circulation. Recent studies indicate that understanding of platelet adhesion signalling mechanisms might enable the development of new strategies to treat and prevent thrombosis.",

They adhere to subendothelial collagens exposed at sites of blood vessel injury via the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-V-IX receptor complex, GPVI and integrin alpha(2)beta(1). These receptors perform distinct functions in the regulation of cell signalling involving non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. Src, Fyn, Lyn, Syk and Btk), adaptor proteins, phospholipase C and lipid kinases such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase. They are also coupled to an increase in cytosolic calcium levels and protein kinase C activation, leading to the secretion of paracrine/autocrine platelet factors and an increase in integrin receptor affinities. Through the binding of plasma fibrinogen and von Willebrand Factor to integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3), a platelet thrombus is formed. Although increasing evidence indicates that each of the adhesion receptors GPIb-V-IX and GPVI and integrins alpha(2)beta(1) and alpha(IIb)beta(3) contribute to the signalling that regulates this process, the individual roles of each are only beginning to be dissected. By contrast, adhesion receptor signalling through platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) is implicated in the inhibition of platelet function and thrombus formation in the healthy circulation. Recent studies indicate that understanding of platelet adhesion signalling mechanisms might enable the development of new strategies to treat and prevent thrombosis.",

Therefore, we sought concento determine if still other integrins implicated in angio- genesis, a5b1, a fibronectin receptor (Bloch et al., 1997), and a2b1, a collagen receptor (Senger et al., 1997), might be activated by VEGF165. In cell migration assays, VEGF165 markedly stimulated HUVEC movement onto effibronectin (see Figure 3A). The migrating cells exhibited extensive spreading, much more so than for their aVb3- mediated migration onto vitronectin (see Figure 2A). shown in Figure 3B, VEGF165-enhanced migration was only partly dependent upon aVb3 activation (partial inhi- bition by c7E3) and partly dependent upon a5b1; mAb JBS5 to a5b1 produced marked inhibition. The combina- tion of mAbs c7E3 and JBS5 produced full inhibition cell migration. Thus, integrin a5b1 also can be activated tranwhen HUVECs are stimulated with VEGF165. A similar conclusion was reached with regard to VEGF165 activa- tion of integrin a2b1 using Type I collagen as a matrix (Figure 3C). The role of a2b1 in this migration was con- firmed using blocking mAb BHA2.1. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the VEGF165 can acti- vate the major integrins, aVb3, aVb5, a5b1, and a2b1, implicated in angiogenesis.",

We previously demonstrated that in keratinocytes, haptotactic migration on laminin-5 was stimulated by anti-beta1 integrin-activating antibody TS2/16, whereas antibodies to alpha6 and beta4, respectively, blocked TS2/16-induced, alpha3beta1-dependent migration. Moreover, alpha6beta4-associated haptotaxis inhibition was linked to a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and required erbB2 activation. erbB2, the ligand-less member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, was shown to form a complex with the hemidesmosomal integrin alpha6beta4. Here, we demonstrate that alpha6beta4 inhibitory effects on haptotaxis are abolished by an anti-E-cadherin antibody, which interferes with cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, antibodies to alpha6 and beta4 stimulated adhesion to an E-cadherin-Fc recombinant protein. In addition, anti-alpha6/beta4 antibodies increased colony size in plated cells, stimulated cell-cell aggregation, and up-regulated E-cadherin localization to cell-cell contacts. These effects were abolished when erbB2 or PI3K were blocked. These results indicate that stimulation of alpha6beta4 increases E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and that this mechanism depends on erbB2 activation. The molecule that links alpha6beta4 with E-cadherin may be the small GTPase cdc42, an effector of PI3K, because dominant-negative cdc42 abolished the inhibitory effect of anti-alpha6/beta4 antibodies and increased basal migration, whereas constitutively active cdc42 prevented the TS2/16-induced increase in haptotaxis. These findings suggest a model whereby alpha6beta4 can augment cell-cell adhesion and slow down haptotaxis over laminin-5 and point to the alpha6beta4-erbB2 heterodimer as an important signaling complex for the formation of cohesive keratinocyte layers. Keratinocyte integrins alpha6beta4 and alpha3beta1 bind laminin-5",

We previously demonstrated that in keratinocytes, haptotactic migration on laminin-5 was stimulated by anti-beta1 integrin-activating antibody TS2/16, whereas antibodies to alpha6 and beta4, respectively, blocked TS2/16-induced, alpha3beta1-dependent migration. Moreover, alpha6beta4-associated haptotaxis inhibition was linked to a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and required erbB2 activation. erbB2, the ligand-less member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, was shown to form a complex with the hemidesmosomal integrin alpha6beta4. Here, we demonstrate that alpha6beta4 inhibitory effects on haptotaxis are abolished by an anti-E-cadherin antibody, which interferes with cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, antibodies to alpha6 and beta4 stimulated adhesion to an E-cadherin-Fc recombinant protein. In addition, anti-alpha6/beta4 antibodies increased colony size in plated cells, stimulated cell-cell aggregation, and up-regulated E-cadherin localization to cell-cell contacts. These effects were abolished when erbB2 or PI3K were blocked. These results indicate that stimulation of alpha6beta4 increases E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and that this mechanism depends on erbB2 activation. The molecule that links alpha6beta4 with E-cadherin may be the small GTPase cdc42, an effector of PI3K, because dominant-negative cdc42 abolished the inhibitory effect of anti-alpha6/beta4 antibodies and increased basal migration, whereas constitutively active cdc42 prevented the TS2/16-induced increase in haptotaxis. These findings suggest a model whereby alpha6beta4 can augment cell-cell adhesion and slow down haptotaxis over laminin-5 and point to the alpha6beta4-erbB2 heterodimer as an important signaling complex for the formation of cohesive keratinocyte layers. Keratinocyte integrins alpha6beta4 and alpha3beta1 bind laminin-5",

Certain tumor cells exhibited high spontaneous adhesion and migration, which were attributable to a VEGF-dependent autocrine/paracrine activation of integrins. This activation was mediated by the VEGFR2 receptor and regulated via phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, Akt, and the PTEN signaling axis. Thus, integrin activation provides a mechanism for VEGF to induce a broad spectrum of cellular responses.",

Our data demonstrated that the cells which were incubated with galectin-3 prior to plating had significantly reduced adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. This inhibition involved the carbohydrate recognition domain of the lectin because adhesion was achieved in the presence of galectin-3 and lactose but not galectin-3 and sucrose.

Certain tumor cells exhibited high spontaneous adhesion and migration, which were attributable to a VEGF-dependent autocrine/paracrine activation of integrins. This activation was mediated by the VEGFR2 receptor and regulated via phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, Akt, and the PTEN signaling axis.

The ability of mRon to activate the MAP kinase pathway is dependent on c-Src activity, and we have shown that c-Src co-immunoprecipitates with mRon. c-Src fails to interact with mRon when the three tyrosines required for MAP kinase activation are mutated, whereas the presence of any one of these tyrosines alone restores Erk phosphorylation and recruitment of c-Src.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case.

              "summary_text": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is a central pathway that transmits signals from many extracellular agents to regulate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and cell cycle progression. The signaling via the ERK cascade is mediated by sequential phosphorylation and activation of protein kinases in the different tiers of the cascade. Although the main core phosphorylation chain of the cascade includes Raf kinases, MEK1/2, ERK1/2 (ERKs) and RSKs, other alternatively spliced forms and distinct components exist in the different tiers, and participate in ERK signaling under specific conditions. These components enhance the complexity of the ERK cascade and thereby, enable the wide variety of functions that are regulated by it. Another factor that is important for the dissemination of ERKs' signals is the multiplicity of the cascade's substrates, which include transcription factors, protein kinases and phosphatases, cytoskeletal elements, regulators of apoptosis, and a variety of other signaling-related molecules. About 160 substrates have already been discovered for ERKs, and the list of these substrates, as well as the function and mechanism of activation of representative substrates, are described in the current review. Many of these substrates are localized in the nucleus, and seem to participate in the regulation of transcription upon stimulation. However, other substrates are found in the cytosol as well as in other cellular organelles, and those are responsible for processes such as translation, mitosis and apoptosis. Understanding of these processes may provide a full picture of the distinct, and even opposing cellular processes that are regulated by the ERK cascade.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case.

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Interestingly, VEGF diminished the expression of TIMP-1 and especially TIMP-2.",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

However, the binding of NF-kB to DNA is not affected by inhibiting AKT, indicating that AKT might be involved in the phosphorylation of the p65 transactivation domain. A dominant-negative mutant of MyD88 was shown to block the kinase activity of AKT generated in response to LPS and IL-1, and a dominant-negative mutant of p85 inhibited the NF-kB activity elicited by LPS and IL-1 but not that elicited by TNF85. These findings indicate that PI3K is a positive mediator of the signalling induced by LPS and IL-1 that leads to NF-kB activation. However, recent studies using mice that lack the p85 regulatory subunit showed an increased production of IL-12 by DCs, possibly because of enhanced activation of the p38 MAPK, indicating that PI3K might have a negative role in TLR signalling in DCs86.  ECSIT. ECSIT has no homology with any known protein and was cloned as a TRAF6-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening87. ECSIT interacts with the conserved TRAF domain of TRAF6. A Drosophila homologue of ECSIT has been identified, and the interaction between TRAF6 and ECSIT is also conserved in Drosophila. ECSIT also interacts with MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase kinase 1), which can phosphorylate and activate the IKK complex. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ECSIT blocks signalling through TLR4, indicating that ECSIT might transduce TLR signals by bridging TRAF6 and the IKK complex. Furthermore, the inhibition of ECSIT expression, using siRNA in a macrophage cell line, resulted in impaired LPS-induced, but not TNF-induced, NF-kB activation88. The physiological function of ECSIT was studied by generating ECSIT-deficient mice, which were found to die on about embryonic day 7.5 (Ref. 88). Further characterization showed that ECSIT is an obligatory intermediate in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, and therefore ECSIT is an essential component in both the TLR- and BMP-signalling pathways.  SRC family of tyrosine kinases. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the SRC-related TEC-family of protein tyrosine kinases and has an essential role in B-cell development and B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signalling. Macrophages from X-linked-immunodeficient mice that lack BTK show reduced responses to LPS, and BTK has also been found to associate with the TIR domain of TLR4,TLR6, TLR8 and TLR9 (Ref. 89). It has also been shown to associate with MyD88, TIRAP and IRAK1, and to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to LPS, whereas a dominant-negative form of BTK inhibits LPS-induced activation of NF-kB, indicating that BTK is involved in the TLR-mediated signalling pathway. During BCR-mediated signalling, BTK interacts with and is activated by the SRC family of tyrosine kinases, such as FYN, LYN and haematopoietic-cell kinase, HCK; however, SRC-family kinases have only a minor role in LPS signalling90. Therefore, the involvement of BTK in TLR signalling needs to be further investigated.  MAPKKK. Members of the MAPKKK family - such as TAK1, MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, TPL2 (tumour-progression locus 2; also known as cancer Osaka thyroid, COT) and NIK - are implicated in IKK-NF-kB and MAPK activation. Among these members, MEKK3 has been shown to be involved in signalling through TLR4 but not through TLR9 (Ref. 91): in response to stimulation with a TLR4 ligand but not a TLR9 ligand, embryonic fibroblasts from MEKK3-deficient mice were shown to have impaired IL-6 production and defective activation of NF-kB, JNK and the p38 MAPK. Stimulation of TLR4 also induced association of MEKK3 with TRAF6. So, MEKK3 is involved in the TLR4-mediated signalling pathway. Another member of the MKKK family, TPL2 has been shown to be involved in the TLR4-mediated activation of ERK92. In response to TLR4 ligand, TPL2-deficient...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

The result shown in Fig. 4B indicates that phosphorylated MAPK was increased in all the regions of the brain exposed to ETS as compared to control brain tissue. The same extracts were probed with anti- ERK antibody and the level of ERK was unchanged in all the lanes indicating equal loading of proteins as well as specificity of the phosphorylation of the MAPK because ERK also undergoes phoshorylation but through different signaling pathway [31]. These results therefore strongly suggest that ETS induces MAPK phosphorylation and that the level of phosphorylation was similar across all the regions of the brain. We next examined the effect of ETS on p38MAP kinase in various regions of the brain. We found that ETS induced the phosphorylation of the p38MAP kinase in all the regions of the brain examined without altering the levels of the p38 MAP kinase protein expression (Fig. 4C).",

              "summary_text": "Asthma is frequently associated with abnormal airway smooth muscle (ASM) growth that may contribute to airway narrowing and hyperresponsiveness to contractile agents. Although numerous hormones and cytokines have been shown to induce human ASM (HASM) proliferation, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying HASM hyperplasia are largely unknown. Here we characterize the roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily [p42/p44 MAPK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), and p38] in mediating hormone- and cytokine-induced HASM proliferation. Significant enhancement of [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in HASM cultures was observed only by treatment with agents (epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, thrombin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) that promoted a strong and sustained activation of p42/p44 MAPK. Significant activation of the JNK/SAPK and p38 pathways was only observed on stimulation with interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, agents that did not appreciably stimulate HASM proliferation. Two different inhibitors of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), PD-98059 and U-0126, inhibited mitogen-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation in a manner consistent with their ability to inhibit p42/p44 activation. Elk-1 and activator protein-1 reporter activation by mitogens was similarly inhibited by inhibition of MEK, suggesting a linkage between p42/p44 activation, transcription factor activation, and HASM proliferation. These findings establish a fundamental role for p42/p44 activation in regulating HASM proliferation and provide insight into species-specific differences observed among studies in ASM mitogenesis.",

              "summary_text": "Despite remarkable progress in dissecting the signaling pathways that are crucial for the metabolic effects of insulin, the molecular basis for the specificity of its cellular actions is not fully understood. One clue might lie in the spatial and temporal aspects of signaling. Recent evidence suggests that signaling molecules and pathways are localized to discrete compartments in cells by specific protein interactions. Also, the rapid termination of tyrosine or lipid phosphorylation by phosphatases or serine kinases might tightly control the strength of a signaling pathway, thus determining its effect on growth, differentiation and metabolism. Insulin is the most potent anabolic hormone known, promoting the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins and inhibiting their degradation and release back into the circulation. Decreased secretion of insulin, coupled with resistance to its actions, results in type 2 diabetes, a devastating disease that is reaching epidemic proportions [1]. Even in the absence of diabetes, insulin resistance is often associated with central obesity, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. At the cellular level, insulin action is characterized by diverse effects, including changes in vesicle trafficking, stimulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, promotion of cellular growth and differentiation and activation or repression of transcription. This complexity suggests that insulin action must involve multiple signaling pathways that diverge at or near the activation of its tyrosine kinase receptor. In fact, it is likely that even individual effects of the hormone require multiple signaling inputs. Evidence is emerging that the coordination of these pathways might be governed by their intracellular compartmentalization or duration of action. Here, we consider how temporal and spatial aspects of signal transduction play a crucial role in determining the specificity of insulin action, focusing on signal initiation from the receptor that is spatially segregated into discrete domains of the plasma membrane, as well as the mechanisms that determine the duration of individual signaling pathways. Together, these factors help to differentiate insulin from other hormones that share some of the same overall signaling properties. Divergent signaling pathways are initiated by insulin receptor substrates. The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins [2], GAB-1 [3], Shc [4], APS [5], p60DOK [6], SIRPS [7] and c-Cbl [8] (Fig. 1). Each of these substrates recruits a distinct subset of signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which interact specifically with sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residue. Moreover, each of these substrates can be confined to distinct locations in the cell by specific sequences that direct interactions with other proteins or lipids. Most attention in the field of insulin receptor substrates has focused on the IRS family of proteins. Mice lacking the IRS-1 protein are insulin resistant but do not develop overt diabetes [9,10]. By contrast, animals lacking IRS-2 exhibit both impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [11], which appears to result from a defect in insulin secretion as well as insulin resistance, presumably owing to decreased b-cell proliferation in the pancreas in the face of increased demand for insulin. Despite the similarity in structure and function, the apparent differences in phenotype between IRS1 and IRS2 knockout mice underscore a specific signaling specificity that probably results from their tissue distribution, subcellular location, activation&ndash;inactivation kinetics and combinatorial interactions with downstream effectors [12]. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS family members generates docking sites for sev...",

              "summary_text": "Simultaneous overexpression of selenophosphate synthetase and phospholipid-hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase (PHGPx) [250] blocks activation of NF-kB by IL-1. Overexpression of SOD [84] or GSH peroxidase [81, 211] abolished NF-kB activation by preventing degradation of IkB after stimulation with TNF-a. The precise mechanism(s) through which oxidants and reductants influence activation of NF-kB is presently unknown; however, there is evidence that antioxidant enzyme (AOE372), a redox-sensitive thioredoxin peroxidase, regulates IkB phosphorylation [246]. Phosphatases The phosphatases are an important component of most signal transduction pathways, because failure to reverse kinase actions can disrupt normal cellular functions. For example, transfection of human fibroblasts with constitutively active ras (hRasV12) inhibits cell growth and ultimately results in a senescentlike phenotype [441]. Similarly, constitutive ERK activation has an inhibitory effect on cell cycle progression [442,443]. Both the serine/threonine phosphatases and the PTPs are known to be redox-sensitive [82,144,153,156,271,281, 444-449]. The mechanism of redox effects on activity is probably best understood for the PTPs. Without exception, the PTPs contain a highly conserved region of 11 amino acid residues in their catalytic domain; specifi- cally, (Ile/Val)-His-Cys-X-Ala-Gly-X-X-Arg-(Ser/Thr)- Gly, where X is a nonconserved amino acid [17]. Either oxidation or mutation of the cysteine renders these molecules inactive [17,281]. H2O2 is a potent inhibitor of PTPs. As in the case of other oxidants, H2O2 probably oxidizes the thiolate anion at the catalytic site [280]. Because formation of a phosphorylcysteine intermediate seems to be critical to PTP activity [450-452], blocking it through oxidation of the cysteine inactivates the molecules. In many cases, treatment of cells with H2O2 stimulates increases in protein phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphatase-catalyzed removal of phosphate groups. Furthermore, mitogens that increase cellular ox- idant production may stimulate phosphorylation indirectly by decreasing phosphatase activity. Additional mechanisms are involved in stimulation of pathways activated by growth factors that increase oxidant production, however, because there are known instances in which the oxidants they produce have no effect on protein phosphorylation. For example, TGF-b1 stimulates phosphorylation of numerous proteins and has been shown to cause a large increase in H2O2 production; however, its effects on protein phosphorylation are not blocked by catalase [453]. Furthermore, H2O2 is effective in promoting phosphorylation of phospholipase D, the PDGF receptor, and PKC-a even after pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts with orthovanadate to inhibit phosphatases [454]. Thus, although diminished phosphatase activity may partially account for increased phosphorylation in some cases, it cannot totally account for oxidation effects on phosphorylation in every case. SPECIFICITY In general, there is good agreement between studies on redox effects on any given gene; albeit, not all oxidizing or reducing treatments exert equivalent effects. This is clearly demonstrated in studies of pag , which encodes a protein associated with cellular proliferation. Pag protein inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the Abelson (abl ) protein by binding to its SH3-binding domain [455]. BSO, menadione, sodium arsenate, and diethyl maleate all stimulate pag expression, but H2O2 does not [269]. Conversely, H2O2 stimulates c-fos expression (Table 1), although 4-hydroynonenal (a product of v-6-polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation) not only fails to induce c-fos expression but is actually inhibitory to c-fos induction by EGF and PDGF [185]. Similarly, some oxidants such as diamide decrease hypoxia-induced signals [201], although others such as H2O2 increase them [124]. As might be expected, the effects of any stimu...",

Reduced expression of E-cadherin and/or catenins was closely correlated with an atypical grade of dysplasia in the basal layer (p<0.05). In particular, downregulation of E-cadherin and/or catenins was associated with an atypical grade of BSM with atypia in intrabronchial lesions (p<0.01). We conclude that downregulation of alpha-catenin and/or beta-catenin, which may reflect dysfunction of the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion system, is an important marker for atypical grade during carcinogenesis of the bronchial epithelium.",

Reduced expression of E-cadherin and/or catenins was closely correlated with an atypical grade of dysplasia in the basal layer (p<0.05). In particular, downregulation of E-cadherin and/or catenins was associated with an atypical grade of BSM with atypia in intrabronchial lesions (p<0.01). We conclude that downregulation of alpha-catenin and/or beta-catenin, which may reflect dysfunction of the cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion system, is an important marker for atypical grade during carcinogenesis of the bronchial epithelium.",

Some of these synergistic effects depend on the physical interaction of integrins with growth factor receptors. Here we examine the nature of the physical interaction between the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGF-Rbeta) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2, also known as KDR and flk-1). Both of these RTKs associate with the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin but do not associate with beta(1) integrins. Furthermore, growth factor stimulation of these RTKs promotes increased cell proliferation and migration when cells are attached to the alpha(v)beta(3) ligand, vitronectin. We show that alpha(v)beta(3) in which the beta(3) cytoplasmic domain is deleted or replaced with the beta(1) cytoplasmic domain coimmunoprecipitates with PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2. The beta(3) extracellular domain alone was sufficient for the PDGF-Rbeta association whereas the VEGF-R2 association required the presence of the alpha(v) subunit. Activation of the RTKs by their ligands was not required for them to associate with the integrin. Cell migration to PDGF was enhanced in the cells transfected with the chimeric subunit containing the beta(3) extracellular domain but not when that domain came from the beta(1) subunit. These results show that the interactions that lead to the association of the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin with PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2 and enhancement of RTK activity take place outside the cell.",

We have localized the alpha(v)beta(3) binding sites in gammaC using gammaC-derived synthetic peptides. We found that two peptides GWTVFQKRLDGSV(190-202) and GVYYQGGTYSKAS(346-358) block the alpha(v)beta(3) binding to gammaC or alpha(E)C, block the alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated clot retraction, and induce the ligand-induced binding site 2 (LIBS2) epitope in alpha(v)beta(3). Neither peptide affects fibrinogen binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3). Scrambled or inverted peptides were not effective. These results suggest that the two gammaC-derived peptides directly interact with alpha(v)beta(3) and specifically block alpha(v)beta(3)-gammaC or alpha(E)C interaction. The two sequences are located next to each other in the gammaC crystal structure, although they are separate in the primary structure. Asp-199, Ser-201, Gln-350, Thr-353, Lys-356, Ala-357, and Ser-358 residues are exposed to the surface. This suggests that the two sequences are part of alpha(v)beta(3) binding sites in fibrinogen gammaC domain. We also found that tenascin C C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain specifically binds to alpha(v)beta(3). Notably, a peptide WYRNCHRVNLMGRYGDNNHSQGVNWFHWKG from this domain that includes the sequence corresponding to gammaC GVYYQGGTYSKAS(346-358) specifically binds to alpha(v)beta(3), suggesting that fibrinogen and tenascin C C-terminal domains interact with alpha(v)beta(3) in a similar manner.",

Its role in tumor biology, however, remains unclear. We investigated whether BSP enhances cancer cell invasiveness by forming a trimolecular complex with MMP-2 and cell-surface integrin alpha(v)beta3. METHODS: Invasiveness of breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid tumor cell lines was measured with a modified Boyden chamber assay. Binding and co-localization of BSP, MMP-2, and integrin alpha(v)beta3 were investigated with immunoprecipitation and in situ hybridization. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Treatment with BSP increased invasiveness of many breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid cancer cells through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner. BSP at 50 nM increased the invasiveness of SW-579 thyroid cancer cells (95.2 units, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 90.4 to 100 units) by approximately 10-fold compared with that of untreated control SW-579 cells (9.1 units, 95% CI = 5.7 to 12.5 units) (P<.001). Addition of an inactive mutated BSP, in which BSP's integrin-binding RGD tripeptide was altered, or addition of integrin alpha(v)beta3-blocking antibodies resulted in invasiveness equivalent to that of untreated cells. Inhibiting cellular MMP-2 activity with chemical inhibitors or a specific antibody also blocked BSP-enhanced invasiveness. Osteopontin and dentin matrix protein 1, proteins related to BSP that also bind integrin alpha(v)beta3 and form complexes with other MMPs (but not MMP-2), did not enhance invasiveness. Immunoprecipitation showed that a complex containing BSP, integrin alpha(v)beta3, and MMP-2 formed in vitro. Addition of BSP increased the amount of MMP-2 bound by cells in an integrin-dependent fashion. Co-expression of BSP, integrin alpha(v)beta3, and MMP-2 in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells was shown by in situ hybridization. CONCLUSION: Cancer cells appear to become more invasive when BSP forms a cell-surface trimolecular complex by linking MMP-2 to integrin alpha(v)beta3.",

CD44v6 is a splice variant of CD44 which has been identified as a marker of cancer progression. In this study, immortalized liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) were used to examine the effect of OPN on two isoforms of CD44: CD44 standard (CD44 s) and CD44v6. Western blots demonstrated that OPN up-regulated plasma membrane CD44v6 protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. CD44v6 levels returned to control levels when OPN-alphavbeta3-integrin binding was blocked by an RGD peptide or tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited. OPN significantly increased CD44v6 protein synthesis, while simultaneously decreasing protein degradation. Steady-state mRNA levels of both CD44s and CD44v6 were unaltered in the presence of OPN stimulation. OPN increased HepG2 in vitro adhesion to hyaluronate (HA); excess soluble HA extinguished OPN-mediated HepG2 adhesion, indicating CD44 dependence. In conclusion, OPN binds to the alphavbeta3-integrin to increase plasma membrane CD44v6 expression and augment in vitro adhesion to HA. This may contribute to the mechanism by which OPN enhances metastatic behavior in hepatocellular cancer cells.",

This multistep process requires extensive signaling through growth factor receptors and integrins. Among the integrins involved in this process, integrin alphavbeta3 is specific to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced angiogenesis. Here we show that junctional adhesion molecule 1/A (JAM-1/A) and alphavbeta3 form a complex in the absence of bFGF. JAM-1, which is normally localized at the cell-cell junctions of quiescent endothelial cells, redistributes to the cell surface on bFGF treatment. Blockage of the extracellular domain of JAM-1 inhibits bFGF-induced endothelial cell morphology, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Additionally, mutation in the JAM-1 cytoplasmic domain blocks bFGF-induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and ablates its ability to induce endothelial cell tube formation, suggesting that signaling through JAM-1 is key to bFGF-induced signaling. Immunoprecipitation analysis suggests that bFGF signaling dissociates the JAM-1/ alphavbeta3 complex, allowing for signaling through JAM-1 and alphavbeta3. In addition, blockage of either JAM-1 or alphavbeta3 inhibits bFGF-induced MAP kinase activation. Thus, our results suggest that signaling through JAM-1 and alphavbeta3 is necessary for bFGF-induced angiogenesis.",

Complement has long been thought to play a significant role in the tumor surveillance mechanism. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN, ETA-1) are expressed by trophoblasts and are strongly up-regulated by many tumors. Indeed, BSP has been shown to be a positive indicator of the invasive potential of some tumors. In this report, we show that BSP and OPN form rapid and tight complexes with complement Factor H. Besides its key role in regulating complement-mediated cell lysis, Factor H also appears to play a role when hijacked by invading organisms in enabling cellular evasion of complement. We have investigated whether BSP and OPN may play a similar role in tumor cell complement evasion by testing to see whether these glycoproteins could promote tumor cell survival. Recombinant OPN and BSP can protect murine erythroleukemia cells from attack by human complement as well as human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and U-266 myeloma cells from attack by guinea pig complement. The mechanism of this gain of function by tumor cell expression of BSP or OPN has been defined using specific peptides and antibodies to block BSP and OPN protective activity. The expression of BSP and OPN in tumor cells provides a selective advantage for survival via initial binding to alpha(V)beta(3) integrin (both) or CD44 (OPN) on the cell surface, followed by sequestration of Factor H to the cell surface and inhibition of complement-mediated cell lysis.",

We describe here a novel pathway that modulates cell migration and that is activated by alphavbeta3 and, as downstream effector, by cdc2 (cdk1). We report that alphavbeta3 expression in LNCaP (beta3-LNCaP) prostate cancer cells causes increased cdc2 mRNA levels as evaluated by gene expression analysis, and increased cdc2 protein and kinase activity levels. We provide three lines of evidence that increased levels of cdc2 contribute to a motile phenotype on integrin ligands in different cell types. First, increased levels of cdc2 correlate with more motile phenotypes of cancer cells. Second, ectopic expression of cdc2 increases cell migration, whereas expression of dominant-negative cdc2 inhibits migration. Third, cdc2 inhibitors reduce cell migration without affecting cell adhesion. We also show that cdc2 increases cell migration via specific association with cyclin B2, and we unravel a novel pathway of cell motility that involves, downstream of cdc2, caldesmon. cdc2 and caldesmon are shown here to localize in membrane ruffles in motile cells. These results show that cdc2 is a downstream effector of the alphavbeta3 integrin, and that it promotes cell migration.",

Some of these synergistic effects depend on the physical interaction of integrins with growth factor receptors. Here we examine the nature of the physical interaction between the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGF-Rbeta) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2, also known as KDR and flk-1). Both of these RTKs associate with the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin but do not associate with beta(1) integrins. Furthermore, growth factor stimulation of these RTKs promotes increased cell proliferation and migration when cells are attached to the alpha(v)beta(3) ligand, vitronectin. We show that alpha(v)beta(3) in which the beta(3) cytoplasmic domain is deleted or replaced with the beta(1) cytoplasmic domain coimmunoprecipitates with PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2. The beta(3) extracellular domain alone was sufficient for the PDGF-Rbeta association whereas the VEGF-R2 association required the presence of the alpha(v) subunit. Activation of the RTKs by their ligands was not required for them to associate with the integrin. Cell migration to PDGF was enhanced in the cells transfected with the chimeric subunit containing the beta(3) extracellular domain but not when that domain came from the beta(1) subunit. These results show that the interactions that lead to the association of the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin with PDGF-Rbeta and VEGF-R2 and enhancement of RTK activity take place outside the cell.",

We have localized the alpha(v)beta(3) binding sites in gammaC using gammaC-derived synthetic peptides. We found that two peptides GWTVFQKRLDGSV(190-202) and GVYYQGGTYSKAS(346-358) block the alpha(v)beta(3) binding to gammaC or alpha(E)C, block the alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated clot retraction, and induce the ligand-induced binding site 2 (LIBS2) epitope in alpha(v)beta(3). Neither peptide affects fibrinogen binding to alpha(IIb)beta(3). Scrambled or inverted peptides were not effective. These results suggest that the two gammaC-derived peptides directly interact with alpha(v)beta(3) and specifically block alpha(v)beta(3)-gammaC or alpha(E)C interaction. The two sequences are located next to each other in the gammaC crystal structure, although they are separate in the primary structure. Asp-199, Ser-201, Gln-350, Thr-353, Lys-356, Ala-357, and Ser-358 residues are exposed to the surface. This suggests that the two sequences are part of alpha(v)beta(3) binding sites in fibrinogen gammaC domain. We also found that tenascin C C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain specifically binds to alpha(v)beta(3). Notably, a peptide WYRNCHRVNLMGRYGDNNHSQGVNWFHWKG from this domain that includes the sequence corresponding to gammaC GVYYQGGTYSKAS(346-358) specifically binds to alpha(v)beta(3), suggesting that fibrinogen and tenascin C C-terminal domains interact with alpha(v)beta(3) in a similar manner.",

We describe here a novel pathway that modulates cell migration and that is activated by alphavbeta3 and, as downstream effector, by cdc2 (cdk1). We report that alphavbeta3 expression in LNCaP (beta3-LNCaP) prostate cancer cells causes increased cdc2 mRNA levels as evaluated by gene expression analysis, and increased cdc2 protein and kinase activity levels. We provide three lines of evidence that increased levels of cdc2 contribute to a motile phenotype on integrin ligands in different cell types. First, increased levels of cdc2 correlate with more motile phenotypes of cancer cells. Second, ectopic expression of cdc2 increases cell migration, whereas expression of dominant-negative cdc2 inhibits migration. Third, cdc2 inhibitors reduce cell migration without affecting cell adhesion. We also show that cdc2 increases cell migration via specific association with cyclin B2, and we unravel a novel pathway of cell motility that involves, downstream of cdc2, caldesmon. cdc2 and caldesmon are shown here to localize in membrane ruffles in motile cells. These results show that cdc2 is a downstream effector of the alphavbeta3 integrin, and that it promotes cell migration.",

Its role in tumor biology, however, remains unclear. We investigated whether BSP enhances cancer cell invasiveness by forming a trimolecular complex with MMP-2 and cell-surface integrin alpha(v)beta3. METHODS: Invasiveness of breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid tumor cell lines was measured with a modified Boyden chamber assay. Binding and co-localization of BSP, MMP-2, and integrin alpha(v)beta3 were investigated with immunoprecipitation and in situ hybridization. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Treatment with BSP increased invasiveness of many breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid cancer cells through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner. BSP at 50 nM increased the invasiveness of SW-579 thyroid cancer cells (95.2 units, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 90.4 to 100 units) by approximately 10-fold compared with that of untreated control SW-579 cells (9.1 units, 95% CI = 5.7 to 12.5 units) (P<.001). Addition of an inactive mutated BSP, in which BSP's integrin-binding RGD tripeptide was altered, or addition of integrin alpha(v)beta3-blocking antibodies resulted in invasiveness equivalent to that of untreated cells. Inhibiting cellular MMP-2 activity with chemical inhibitors or a specific antibody also blocked BSP-enhanced invasiveness. Osteopontin and dentin matrix protein 1, proteins related to BSP that also bind integrin alpha(v)beta3 and form complexes with other MMPs (but not MMP-2), did not enhance invasiveness. Immunoprecipitation showed that a complex containing BSP, integrin alpha(v)beta3, and MMP-2 formed in vitro. Addition of BSP increased the amount of MMP-2 bound by cells in an integrin-dependent fashion. Co-expression of BSP, integrin alpha(v)beta3, and MMP-2 in papillary thyroid carcinoma cells was shown by in situ hybridization. CONCLUSION: Cancer cells appear to become more invasive when BSP forms a cell-surface trimolecular complex by linking MMP-2 to integrin alpha(v)beta3.",

              "summary_text": "Metastatic cancer cells, like trophoblasts of the developing placenta, are invasive and must escape immune surveillance to survive. Complement has long been thought to play a significant role in the tumor surveillance mechanism. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN, ETA-1) are expressed by trophoblasts and are strongly up-regulated by many tumors. Indeed, BSP has been shown to be a positive indicator of the invasive potential of some tumors. In this report, we show that BSP and OPN form rapid and tight complexes with complement Factor H. Besides its key role in regulating complement-mediated cell lysis, Factor H also appears to play a role when hijacked by invading organisms in enabling cellular evasion of complement. We have investigated whether BSP and OPN may play a similar role in tumor cell complement evasion by testing to see whether these glycoproteins could promote tumor cell survival. Recombinant OPN and BSP can protect murine erythroleukemia cells from attack by human complement as well as human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and U-266 myeloma cells from attack by guinea pig complement. The mechanism of this gain of function by tumor cell expression of BSP or OPN has been defined using specific peptides and antibodies to block BSP and OPN protective activity. The expression of BSP and OPN in tumor cells provides a selective advantage for survival via initial binding to alpha(V)beta(3) integrin (both) or CD44 (OPN) on the cell surface, followed by sequestration of Factor H to the cell surface and inhibition of complement-mediated cell lysis.",

This multistep process requires extensive signaling through growth factor receptors and integrins. Among the integrins involved in this process, integrin alphavbeta3 is specific to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced angiogenesis. Here we show that junctional adhesion molecule 1/A (JAM-1/A) and alphavbeta3 form a complex in the absence of bFGF. JAM-1, which is normally localized at the cell-cell junctions of quiescent endothelial cells, redistributes to the cell surface on bFGF treatment. Blockage of the extracellular domain of JAM-1 inhibits bFGF-induced endothelial cell morphology, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Additionally, mutation in the JAM-1 cytoplasmic domain blocks bFGF-induced mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation and ablates its ability to induce endothelial cell tube formation, suggesting that signaling through JAM-1 is key to bFGF-induced signaling. Immunoprecipitation analysis suggests that bFGF signaling dissociates the JAM-1/ alphavbeta3 complex, allowing for signaling through JAM-1 and alphavbeta3. In addition, blockage of either JAM-1 or alphavbeta3 inhibits bFGF-induced MAP kinase activation. Thus, our results suggest that signaling through JAM-1 and alphavbeta3 is necessary for bFGF-induced angiogenesis.",

CD44v6 is a splice variant of CD44 which has been identified as a marker of cancer progression. In this study, immortalized liver carcinoma cells (HepG2) were used to examine the effect of OPN on two isoforms of CD44: CD44 standard (CD44 s) and CD44v6. Western blots demonstrated that OPN up-regulated plasma membrane CD44v6 protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. CD44v6 levels returned to control levels when OPN-alphavbeta3-integrin binding was blocked by an RGD peptide or tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited. OPN significantly increased CD44v6 protein synthesis, while simultaneously decreasing protein degradation. Steady-state mRNA levels of both CD44s and CD44v6 were unaltered in the presence of OPN stimulation. OPN increased HepG2 in vitro adhesion to hyaluronate (HA); excess soluble HA extinguished OPN-mediated HepG2 adhesion, indicating CD44 dependence. In conclusion, OPN binds to the alphavbeta3-integrin to increase plasma membrane CD44v6 expression and augment in vitro adhesion to HA. This may contribute to the mechanism by which OPN enhances metastatic behavior in hepatocellular cancer cells.",

Some tumours also contain lymphatic vessels, as well as channels that consist of cancer cells and their extracellular matrix. These special features of tumour vessels are good targets for cancer therapies.",

We reported previously that the hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein, known to be a causative agent in the formation of HCC, activates insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) expression through Sp1 phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In this report we demonstrate that the PTEN effect on HBx induced IGF-II activation in a hepatoma cell line. Expression of PTEN and IGF-II was inversely related in different hepatoma cell lines. PTEN expression induced decreased Sp1 DNA binding by dephosphorylating Sp1 and interfered with transcriptional transactivation of IGF-II by HBx in hepatoma cells. The protein phosphatase activity was involved in PTEN downregulation of IGF-II transcription through downregulation of MAPK, MAPK kinase phosphorylation and PKC translocation. Our data suggest that PTEN blocks Sp1 phosphorylation in response to HBx, by inactivating PKC, MAPK and MAPK kinase which eventually downregulate IGF-II expression, during the formation of HCC.",

These findings suggest that brain tumors might contain cancer stem cells that are critical for tumor growth. However, the molecular pathways governing such stem cell-like behavior remain largely elusive. Our previous study suggests that the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene, one of the most frequently mutated genes in glioblastomas, restricts neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation in vivo. In the present study, we sought to determine the role of PTEN in long-term maintenance of stem cell-like properties, cell cycle entry and progression, and growth factor dependence and gene expression. Our results demonstrate an enhanced self-renewal capacity and G(0)-G(1) cell cycle entry and decreased growth factor dependency of Pten null neural-stem progenitor cells. Therefore, loss of PTEN leads to cell physiological changes, which collectively are sufficient to increase the pool of self-renewing neural stem cells and promote their escape from the homeostatic mechanisms of proliferation control.",

In endothelial cells PKB/Akt has been reported to be both upstream and downstream of Rac and Cdc42 [81-83]. Endothelial cell migration induced by VEGFR2- stimulation involves integrin activation via a PI-3K and PKB/Akt-dependent signaling pathway [84]. Rho family GTPases. The small GTPases Rho, Rac and Cdc42 participate in the regulation of actin polymerization necessary for the formation of stress fibers, focal adhesions, lamellipodia and filopodia [85], and modulate cell proliferation and gene expression [86,87]. Integrin ligation activates Rho proteins by promoting GTP loading and translocation from the cytosol to the membrane [88]. Rac activity is essential for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis [89,90] and this effect requires the Rac effector protein p21 activated kinase 1 (PAK1). Inhibition of Rac or PAK1 function by dominant negative constructs in endothelial cells in vivo inhibits growth factor-induced angiogenesis [90,91].",
