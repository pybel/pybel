Here, using cultured pulmonary epithelial cells and murine models, we demonstrated that CS causes mitochondrial dysfunction that is associated with a reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential.

Rather, survival of caspase 8-defective T cells can be completely rescued by loss of receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase (Ripk) 3. Additionally, complementation of a T cell-specific caspase 8 deficiency with a loss of Ripk3 gives rise to lymphoproliferative disease reminiscent of lpr or gld mice. In conjunction with previous work, we conclude that necroptosis in antigen-stimulated caspase 8-deficient T cells is the result of a novel Ripk1- and Ripk3-mediated pathway of cell death.",

For example, overexpression of this transcription factor protects epidermal keratinocytes or cervical carcinoma cells from ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced apoptosis [74,75]. In addition, STAT3 deficiency sensitizes keratinocytes to UV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a simple application of a naked STAT3 plasmid on the skin is sufficient to prevent the effect of irradiation. This protective effect was also confirmed in colorectal cancer cell lines where STAT3 inactivation also enhances UV-induced cell death [57]. In multiple myeloma, the aberrant activation of STAT3 has also been shown to confer resistance to FASmediated apoptosis [28]. The inhibition of STAT3 signaling downregulates the expression of survival proteins and restores the sensitivity to cell-death receptors. Furthermore, a constitutively activated form of STAT3 has been shown in vivo to protect liver cells from FAS-mediated apoptosis and necrosis [76]. This has been related to an enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), BCL2, or BCL-XL and a downregulation of FADD-like interleukin-1 b-converting enzyme (FLICE) and caspase 3.",

Fas plays an important role in T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and recently it has been suggested that altered Fas signaling may contribute to drug resistance. Therefore, Fas resistance could be one of the mechanisms by which AML progenitors escape chemotherapy or T-cell-based immune intervention. However, the molecular mechanism of Fas resistance in AML cells has not been identified. Fas signaling can be interrupted at 3 mains levels: Fas clustering, alteration of death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC) formation, and effector caspase inhibition of downstream caspase-8. This study shows that in the Fas-resistant CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1a cells, Fas agonists resulted in Fas aggregation but not in caspase-8 activation, related to a defect in DISC formation. However, pretreatment with chelerythrin, but not with calphostin C, resulted in the restoration of Fas-induced caspase-8 activation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that some atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms contributed to the lack of DISC formation. Indeed, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides directed against PKC zeta and enforced expression of Par-4, a negative regulator of PKC zeta activity, restored Fas-induced caspase-8 activity and apoptosis. Moreover, it was found that PKC zeta interacts with FADD and that PKC zeta immunoextracts prepared from KG1a cells are able to phosphorylate FADD in vitro, whereas this phosphorylation is dramatically reduced in Par-4 transfectant cells. In conclusion, it is suggested that in AML cells, PKC zeta plays an important role in Fas resistance by inhibiting DISC formation, possibly by phosphorylating FADD.",

FAS-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP1) prevents binding of FADD and DAXX (death-associated protein) to FAS, and HSP27 inhibits DAXX-mediated activation of ASK1 (apoptosis signal regulated kinase-1) and the JNK (c-Jun-N-teminal kinase)-death pathway. JNK activity is inhibited by HSP70 and its co-chaperone HSP40, and by the IAPs NIAP (neuronal IAP) and XIAP (X-chromosome linked IAP), with XIAP in a complex with its binding partners TAK1 (TGF?-activated kinase) and TAB1 (TAK1-binding protein). ER (endoplasmic reticulum)- mediated apoptosis is inhibited by ORP150 (oxygen regulated protein 150), which prevents activation of calcium-dependent proteases, and by BCL2 and BAR (bifunctional apoptosis regulator)-mediated suppression of BAP31 (B-cell receptorassociated protein 31). IAP proteins negatively regulate pro-death p75NTR (p75 neurotrophin receptor) signalling through NRAGE (neurotrophin receptor interacting MAGE homologue), preventing signalling through the JNK-death pathway. XIAP mediates survival (blue lines) by binding to the cytoplasmic domain of BMP (bone morphogenic protein) receptors, which recruit TAB1 and TAK1 to activate the NF-?B (nuclear factor-?B) survival pathway. IAPs, HSP27 and HSP90 bind to AKT/PKB (protein kinase B) to promote the AKT survival pathway (blue lines).

Fas plays an important role in T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and recently it has been suggested that altered Fas signaling may contribute to drug resistance. Therefore, Fas resistance could be one of the mechanisms by which AML progenitors escape chemotherapy or T-cell-based immune intervention. However, the molecular mechanism of Fas resistance in AML cells has not been identified. Fas signaling can be interrupted at 3 mains levels: Fas clustering, alteration of death-inducing-signaling-complex (DISC) formation, and effector caspase inhibition of downstream caspase-8. This study shows that in the Fas-resistant CD34(+)CD38(-) KG1a cells, Fas agonists resulted in Fas aggregation but not in caspase-8 activation, related to a defect in DISC formation. However, pretreatment with chelerythrin, but not with calphostin C, resulted in the restoration of Fas-induced caspase-8 activation and cytotoxicity, suggesting that some atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms contributed to the lack of DISC formation. Indeed, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides directed against PKC zeta and enforced expression of Par-4, a negative regulator of PKC zeta activity, restored Fas-induced caspase-8 activity and apoptosis. Moreover, it was found that PKC zeta interacts with FADD and that PKC zeta immunoextracts prepared from KG1a cells are able to phosphorylate FADD in vitro, whereas this phosphorylation is dramatically reduced in Par-4 transfectant cells. In conclusion, it is suggested that in AML cells, PKC zeta plays an important role in Fas resistance by inhibiting DISC formation, possibly by phosphorylating FADD.",

For example, overexpression of this transcription factor protects epidermal keratinocytes or cervical carcinoma cells from ultraviolet radiation (UV)-induced apoptosis [74,75]. In addition, STAT3 deficiency sensitizes keratinocytes to UV-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, a simple application of a naked STAT3 plasmid on the skin is sufficient to prevent the effect of irradiation. This protective effect was also confirmed in colorectal cancer cell lines where STAT3 inactivation also enhances UV-induced cell death [57]. In multiple myeloma, the aberrant activation of STAT3 has also been shown to confer resistance to FASmediated apoptosis [28]. The inhibition of STAT3 signaling downregulates the expression of survival proteins and restores the sensitivity to cell-death receptors. Furthermore, a constitutively activated form of STAT3 has been shown in vivo to protect liver cells from FAS-mediated apoptosis and necrosis [76]. This has been related to an enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), BCL2, or BCL-XL and a downregulation of FADD-like interleukin-1 b-converting enzyme (FLICE) and caspase 3.",

These interactions ultimately lead to the recruitment of the FAS-associated death domain (FADD) and the activation of the protease caspase 8.

At the present, there is no study reporting phosphorylation/activation of NIK under ischemic conditions. This study provided the first evidence that p-NIK was up-regulated in the ischemic cortex, indicating that NIK is activated by cerebral ischemic insults. Furthermore, GKAB could suppress the phosphorylation/activation of NIK. Taken together, these results suggest that GKAB may inhibit ischemia-induced NF-kappaB activation by IkappaBalpha degradation via suppression of the NIK-IKK pathway.",

Interactions with amyloid precursor proteins, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, have been demonstrated to inhibit HO-1 activity, resulting in a compromised stress defense (Takahashi et al., 2000; Takahashi and Snyder, 2000; Wagener et al., 2003b). On the other hand, Buelow and colleagues have demonstrated that the synthetic peptide RDP1258 can bind HO-1 and cause increased HO-1 expression and activity in vivo (Cuturi et al., 1999; Magee et al., 1999). This protein has further shown to be highly effective in ameliorating a range of inflammatory conditions (Cuturi et al., 1999; Oberyszyn et al., 2001).  Thus, HO seems to be cytoprotective by limiting the influx of activated inflammatory cells and by ameliorating the extent of cellular necrosis and apoptosis in injured tissues. On the other hand, too high HO-1 expression may also cause tissue injury by the generation of high levels of iron or result in bilirubinemia (Suttner and Dennery, 1999).   V. The Heme-Heme Oxygenase System Top Previous Next   The heme-heme oxygenase system is tightly involved in both physiological as well as pathophysiological processes, such as cytoprotection, apoptosis, and inflammation. A better understanding of the complex heme-heme oxygenase system may provide us with novel tools to combat diverse conditions, such as inflammation, wound healing, transplant rejection, sickle cell disease, and cancer (Lane, 1998; Maines, 2000; Wagener et al., 2003a).  A. The Heme-Heme Oxygenase-1 System and Apoptosis  Under oxidative and inflammatory conditions necrosis and apoptosis may occur, which result in the release of large amounts of heme and subsequently exacerbation of the inflammatory process and cellular injury. However, under these conditions the stress-responsive protein HO-1 will be immediately induced as well. ",

Of these four stages, the last two are the least well understood. Quite little is known of how the perpetrators affect the structures and functions and whether and how each of these changes contribute to cell death. According to this description, the key step in ischemic cell death is adequate activation of the perpetrators, and thus a major unifying thread of the review is a consideration of how the changes occurring during and after ischemia, including gene activation and synthesis of new proteins, conspire to produce damaging levels of free radicals and peroxynitrite, to activate calpain and other Ca(2+)-driven processes that are damaging, and to initiate the apoptotic process. Although it is not fully established for all cases, the major driving force for the necrotic cell death process, and very possibly the other processes, appears to be the generation of free radicals and peroxynitrite.",

The extrinsic death pathway is initiated by binding of the extracellular ligands, TNFa (tumour necrosis factor-a) or FAS (apoptosis antigen-1) ligand (FASL), to death receptors TNFR1 (TNF-receptor1) and FAS. TNFR1 activation leads to the formation of a TRADD RIP TRAF2 (TNF receptor death domain receptor interacting protein TNF associated factor 2) complex, which signals through the NFkB (nuclear factorkB) survival pathway (blue lines) or the JNK (cJun N teminal kinase)death pathway (black lines). RIP activates procaspase 2 and cleaves BID (BH3 (BCL2 (B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2) homology domain 3) interacting agonist). The TRADD FADD FLICE (TNF receptor death domain FAS associated death domain FADD like interleukin 1b) complex activates procaspase 8, triggering apoptosis through caspase 3 or cleavage of BID to tBID (truncated BID). FAS-mediated death occurs through a FADD-mediated activation of procaspase 8 or DAXX (death-associated protein )-mediated activation of JNK. JNK modifies BID to jBID, allowing its translocation to the mitochondrion and release of SMAC/DIABLO (second-mitochondrialderived activator of caspases). The intrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated at the mitochondrion by diverse stimuli. Membrane permeabilization is mediated by BH3-only proteins, which sequester and inhibit the supression of BAX (B-cell lymphoma 2-associated protein X) by BCL2, allowing mitochondrial BAX translocation and the release of cytochrome c (Cyto c), SMAC/DIABLO, AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) and HTRA2/OMI (high temperature requirement serine protease 2).",

In this case, pharmacological inhibition of PARP or genetic deletion of the PARP-1 preserves cellular NAD+ and ATP pools in oxidatively and/or nitrosatively stressed cardiomyocytes, endothelial or other cell types, thereby allowing them to function normally, or, if the apoptotic process has initiated, to utilize the apoptotic machinery and die by apoptosis instead of necrosis",

A major band, corresponding to the 26 kDa cleavage product of 35S-PARP was identified after incubation with extracts from IgMFAS-stimulated control cells (Figure 8). The intensity of the band was fivefold lower after PARP incubation with extracts from FAS-unstimulated cells. Most important, in this assay, PARP cleavage was threefold less effective in PED overexpressing than in control cells. No 26 kDa band was detectable in the absence of cell extract addition. Thus, cleavage of death substrates by active FLICE occurs less efficiently in cells overexpressing PED.",

RIP is critical for the activation of IKK, whereas TRAF2 recruits IKK into the TNFR complex7 . However, it is not clear how RIP activates IKK. Because MEKK3 was absolutely required for optimal IKK activation by TNF (Fig. 3a), one possibility was that MEKK3 is a key target molecule of RIP in TNF-induced IKK activation. We used RIP-/- and TRAF2-/- MEFs, both of which have defective TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, to investigate this possibility10, 11, 23 . If MEKK3 is a downstream target of TRAF2 and RIP, MEKK3-mediated NF-kappaB activation should not be affected in these cells. We found that transfection of Map3k3 into both RIP-/- and TRAF2-/- MEFs resulted in strong IKK activation, which was similar to that observed in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 3e). Expression of Map3k3 in these cells also resulted in activation of the NF-kappaB reporter gene in RIP-/- and TRAF2-/- MEFs (Fig. 3f). In contrast, expression of cDNA encoding TRAF2 or RIP activated IKK in the wild-type but not in the MEKK3-/- MEFs (Fig. 3g). These data thus identified MEKK3 as a downstream effector kinase of TRAF2 and RIP in IKK and NF-kappaB activation.",

For TNF-R1 signaling, it is known that the binding of TNF to TNF-R1 leads to the recruitment of TRADD (TNF-R1-associated death domain protein) into the receptor complex 11. TRADD subsequently recruits other effector proteins into the complex. FADD/MORT1 (FAS-associated death domain protein), TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor 2), and the death domain kinase RIP (receptor interacting protein) have been shown to interact directly with TRADD 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. While FADD/MORT1 is essential for TNF-induced apoptosis through activating a caspase cascade, RIP and TRAF2 are critical in the activation of NF-kappaB and JNK 17, 18, 19, 20.",

It has been shown that the C-terminal portion of this protein is sufficient for binding and activation of TAK1, while a portion of the N-terminus acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of TGF beta, suggesting that this protein may function as a mediator between TGF beta receptors and TAK1. This protein can also interact with and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14/p38alpha), and thus represents an alternative activation pathway, in addition to the MAPKK pathways, which contributes to the biological responses of MAPK14 to various stimuli. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported.",

However, this molecular mechanism of activation is not yet understood. We show here that endogenous TAK1 is constitutively associated with TAB1 and phosphorylated following IL-1 stimulation. Furthermore, TAK1 is constitutively phosphorylated when ectopically overexpressed with TAB1. In both cases, dephosphorylation of TAK1 renders it inactive, but it can be reactivated by preincubation with ATP. A mutant of TAK1 that lacks kinase activity is not phosphorylated either following IL-1 treatment or when coexpressed with TAB1, indicating that TAK1 phosphorylation is due to autophosphorylation. Furthermore, mutation to alanine of a conserved serine residue (Ser-192) in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII abolishes both phosphorylation and activation of TAK1. These results suggest that IL-1 and ectopic expression of TAB1 both activate TAK1 via autophosphorylation of Ser-192.",

Recently, patients with an inherited IRAK4 deficiency have been identified29. These patients failed to respond to IL-1, to IL-18 or to stimulation of each of five TLRs (TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9). Together, these results show that IRAK4 and its kinase activity are required for TLR signalling and that IRAK4 functions upstream of IRAK1.  TRAF6. TRAFs constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved adaptor proteins30. So far, six members of the TRAF family have been identified in mammals, and they are characterized by the presence of an N-terminal coiled-coil domain (known as TRAF-N) and a conserved C-terminal domain (known as TRAF-C). The N-terminal portion of most TRAF proteins contains a RING (really interesting new gene)-finger/zinc-finger region, which is essential for downstream signalling events, whereas the TRAF-C domain mediates self-association and interactions with upstream receptors and signalling proteins. TRAF6 functions as a signalling mediator for both the TNF-receptor superfamily and the TLR/IL-1R superfamily, interacting directly with members of the TNF-receptor superfamily (CD40 and TNF-related activation-induced cytokine receptor, TRANCER) or being coupled indirectly to TLR/IL-1R superfamily members through its association with IRAKs. The consensus sequence for the TRAF6-binding domain has been identified as P-X-E-X-X-(D/E/F/W/Y)31. This motif is found in CD40, TRANCER, and the IRAKs; three of these TRAF6-binding motifs are found in IRAK1, two in IRAK2 and one in IRAK-M.  TAK1 and TABs. The activation by TRAF6 of the transcription factors NF-kB and activator protein 1 (AP1) involves TAK1 and two adaptor proteins TAB1 and TAB2. TAK1 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family32, which has been shown to be essential for both IL-1/LPS- and TNF-induced NF-kB activation33. Two TAK1-binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2, have been identified34, 35. When co-expressed ectopically, TAB1 enhances the kinase activity of TAK1, indicating that TAB1 functions as an activator of TAK134. By contrast, TAB2 functions as an adaptor, linking TAK1 to TRAF6 and thereby facilitating TAK1 activation35. However, embryonic fibroblasts obtained from TAB2-deficient mice show no impairment in either IL-1/LPS- or TNF-induced activation of NF-kB36. Furthermore, a new TAB2-like molecule, TAB3, has been identified recently, and similar to TAB2, it has been shown to associate with TAK1 and activate NF-kB37. Co-transfection of SMALL INTERFERING RNAS (siRNAs) directed against both TAB2 and TAB3 inhibited both IL-1- and TNF-induced activation of TAK1 and NF-kB, indicating that TAB2 and TAB3 function redundantly as mediators of TAK1 activation.  It has been shown that UBIQUITYLATION has an important role in TAK1 activation and that TRAF6 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase38. TRAF6 can interact through its RING-finger domain with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (UBC13), and this UBC13-TRAF6 complex triggers TAK1 activation through the assembly of a lysine63-linked polyubiquitin chain39.  NF-kB. The NF-kB family of transcription factors is composed of five members - p65 (REL-A), REL-B, cytoplasmic (c) REL, p50 and p52 - which function as homo- and heterodimers. NF-kB dimers are usually sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive form by molecules of the inhibitor of NF-kB (IB) family. Activation of NF-kB involves the phosphorylation and proteolysis of the IB proteins and the concomitant release and nuclear translocation of the NF-kB factors. This acute activation process is mediated by the IB kinase (IKK) complex, which comprises two catalytic subunits - IKK- and IKK- (also kn...",

              "summary_text": "Thus it is logical that exercise, a modality that alters systemic energy flux and balance, would change plasma leptin concentration. Many studies have examined the effects of exercise on circulating levels of leptin with the thought that leptin sensitivity would be improved and plasma leptin concentrations reduced. Circulating leptin has been measured in response to short- (45) and long-term exercise training (11, 39, 51, 60, 80, 86, 87, 90, 101) and after single bouts of exercise (maximal, submaximal, short duration, and long duration) (20, 21, 24, 30, 39, 53, 61, 63-65, 77, 81, 87, 89, 96, 102, 110, 118). Short-term training does not influence fasting plasma leptin levels (45). Long-term exercise training decreases circulating leptin, but generally not independent of changes in fat mass (11, 60, 80, 87, 90, 101). Several long-term training investigations have demonstrated reductions in plasma leptin independent of weight reduction (40, 51, 86), but it is unclear whether these changes were due to long-term exercise training or were a result of the last exercise bout. Studies examining the leptin response to single bouts of exercise have produced equivocal results, but it appears that circulating leptin levels are only decreased by exercise bouts of considerably high intensity (21) and long duration (20, 61, 64, 65, 81, 118). In a report from Hilton and Loucks (41), energy intake and exercise-associated energy expenditure were controlled to distinguish the independent effects of energy availability and exercise stress on the diurnal leptin rhythm in healthy young women. When dietary energy intake was sufficient to compensate for the energy cost of exercise, the suppressive effects of exercise on 24-h leptin levels were prevented. Thus the only influence of exercise on the 24-h mean and amplitude of leptin was due to an induction of a negative energy balance caused by the energy cost of exercise. Furthermore, they concluded that the diurnal rhythm of leptin depends on energy and/or carbohydrate availability, which are variables directly influenced by exercise. On the basis of the current evidence, reductions in circulating leptin in response to short-term exercise and/or single bouts of exercise do not appear to be due to exercise stress but are more likely the result of an induction of a negative energy balance. A change in leptin after long-term exercise training is primarily due to reduced fat mass and/or a result of the negative energy balance induced by the previous exercise bout. TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha is a proinflammatory cytokine secreted from a variety of cells including macrophages, muscle (94), and adipose tissue (44). Recent evidence indicates that most of the TNF-alpha secreted by adipose tissue is derived from macrophage infiltration or other nonfat cell sources (25-27). TNF-alpha is a 26-kDa protein that undergoes posttranslational modification to form its active 17-kDa structure (74). TNF-alpha signaling is mediated by the transmembrane receptors TNF-alpha receptor 1 (p55) and TNF-alpha receptor 2 (p75).",

Dying cells were shrunken, and their nuclei were small and condensed without typical apoptotic body formation (Fig. 3b). Release of LDH into the culture medium implying rupture of cell membrane was detected (Fig. 3c). However, we did not detect caspase cleavage activity (data not shown). In line with these findings, necrostatin-1 effectively suppressed BNip3-induced cell death and LDH release while the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK did not (Fig. 3a). At this concentration of caspase inhibitor, cell death induced by Bax overexpression was suppressed (Fig. 3a). These results suggest that BNip3 induces caspase-independent necrosis-like cell death similar to that encountered after treating cells with TNF. ",

All of these events were significantly blunted by inhibitors of sphingomyelinase, PKCzeta, NADPH oxidases, Yes, or EGFR-tyrosine kinase activity and after protein knockdown of either p47phox, Yes, or EGFR. The data suggest that CD95L-induced apoptosis involves a sphingomyelinase- and PKCzeta-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase isoforms, which is required for Yes/EGFR/CD95 interactions as upstream events of CD95 activation.",

For a mechanism predicted from COPD data it was incorporated into a network with an edge based on COPD studies if available, and if not healthy context was used to incorporate these COPD mechanisms. Literature describing processes active in acute exacerbation in COPD patients was excluded from supporting edges of the network models. We prioritized data collected from studies of lung and COPD-relevant cell types, but excluded literature related to asthma or bronchitis. We excluded cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, all virus infections, all bacterial infections, septic pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), allergic responses/asthma, pneumoconiosis, and COPD exacerbations. We also excluded animal inhalation studies with solid particles (titanium dioxide, quartz, asbestos, carbon black, diesel exhaust etc). For the in vitro-specific exclusion criteria we excluded tumor-derived cell lines, immortalized cell lines, neuronal cells, and cell types that cannot be found in the respiratory/vascular system. There were some exceptions where we included immortalized cell lines and non-lung cell types for canonical mechanisms where there was evidence that the relationship was not tissue-specific but could also take place in the lung. Human-specific connections were preferred, but rat and mouse were also included where human data was not available.",
